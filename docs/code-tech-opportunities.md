# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-11T22:00:23.590360+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The best zero-budget route is: build a small product that runs entirely client-side or ships as a downloadable file, host it free on GitHub (Releases for binaries, Pages for a static landing page), and take payment only via the already-validated Tron (TRC-20) USDT receive address printed in the README, FUNDING.yml, --help output, and product page — a receive path that needs no account, no KYC, and no custodian. Add Getly as the one storefront with native crypto settlement to the same wallet for buyers who want a checkout flow, and a Chrome Web Store listing if the product is an extension (the only non-zero cost, a one-time $5). Marketing runs on the dev.to publishing pipeline that already exists: an article about the problem the product solves, with the address in the footer. After the one-time setup, every sale is a download or an on-chain transfer the owner never touches.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct wallet ask (already live) | Receive USDT (TRC-20) on a validated address printed on product pages, READMEs, FUNDING.yml, and in-tool output | $0; Tron network fees are paid by the sender | USDT on Tron (TRC-20), direct to the owner's own wallet, no custodian, no KYC | None — the address is already appended to every dev.to article; add it once to the product page, README, FUNDING.yml, and release notes | Payment is an on-chain transfer the owner never processes; the balance is verifiable without any action per sale |
| GitHub Releases + repo (FUNDING.yml, README) | Free hosting of binaries/archives and a rendered sponsor/funding button in the repo | $0 — same account that already hosts the code; no listing fee, no approval queue | None from GitHub itself (GitHub Sponsors is fiat and needs the owner to enable it); payment flows via the address placed in README/FUNDING.yml custom field and release bodies | One-time: push the product, create a Release with the download, add the address to .github/FUNDING.yml (custom field), README, and each release body | Downloads are served by GitHub; the ask travels with every copy and every fork; nothing can freeze a payout |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with card and crypto checkout for downloadable products | No monthly fee; Tron payout minimum $15 (~$5 on BNB Smart Chain); network fee roughly $0.50–1 on Tron — verify current terms for exact fees | USDT/USDC; Tron (TRC-20) supported, settled directly to the seller's own wallet address, no KYC for crypto settlement | One-time: sign up, create the product listing, paste the validated TRC-20 payout address, upload the deliverable | The storefront handles checkout and delivery automatically; the owner only watches the wallet balance |
| Chrome Web Store (if the product is an extension) | The distribution channel with real organic discovery for browser extensions | One-time $5 developer registration per account, covers up to 20 extensions, no renewal; store takes no cut of a free extension | None — the store does not pay out; monetisation is the free listing funneling users to the wallet ask or a paid upgrade sold via Getly or direct address | One-time: pay $5 (the only non-zero cost in this plan), package and upload the extension, list the product page URL carrying the receive address | The store serves installs and reviews forever; each install carries the in-tool ask |
| dev.to article as the marketing channel (already running) | Daily publishing pipeline that already appends the receive address to every article | $0 — infrastructure already paid for and running | Via the address already appended to each article; USDT on TRC-20 to own wallet | One-time: write one problem-focused article (problem-workaround shape outperforms tutorials ~25x on this account) where the product is the fix | The article and its footer ask keep working on the back catalogue after publication, with no owner action |

## Product Ideas

1. **Client-side browser extension fixing one specific annoyance**
   - Who buys: Power users of one popular site who hit the same friction daily
   - Deliverable: Extension install from the Chrome Web Store; paid tier unlocks advanced features via a licence key delivered by Getly
   - Pricing model: Free core extension plus paid upgrade (freemium)
   - Cost per extra user: $0 — all logic runs client-side in the extension
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store listing + GitHub repo for issues/docs; Getly for paid-tier checkout
2. **Single-purpose CLI utility sold as a downloadable binary**
   - Who buys: Developers or sysadmins with a narrow repeated task
   - Deliverable: Static binary or script on GitHub Releases; address in README and in the tool's --help/about output
   - Pricing model: Free download with an honest pay-what-you-want wallet ask, or one-time licence via Getly for a pro build
   - Cost per extra user: $0 — GitHub serves the files
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases, GitHub Actions for builds, README/FUNDING.yml receive address
3. **Template/preset/asset pack for a tool people already use**
   - Who buys: Users of that tool who want a finished result instead of building from scratch
   - Deliverable: A downloadable archive built once and served forever
   - Pricing model: One-time licence, pay-what-you-want, or fixed price via Getly; wallet address as a no-platform fallback
   - Cost per extra user: $0 — a file downloaded many times
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases hosting + Pages landing page + dev.to article describing the problem the pack solves
4. **Static web tool that runs entirely client-side**
   - Who buys: Anyone searching for that one conversion/fix/calculation
   - Deliverable: Free hosted tool; paid tier is a downloadable offline/pro version sold via wallet address or Getly
   - Pricing model: Free tool plus paid downloadable pro version
   - Cost per extra user: $0 — no server; GitHub Pages serves static files
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages for hosting, the existing repo, the validated TRC-20 address on the page footer

## Next Actions

- Pick the smallest product shape (extension, CLI tool, or asset pack) and finish one build this week; add the validated TRC-20 address to the README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, and every release body.
- Host the deliverable on GitHub Releases (free) and stand up a one-page GitHub Pages site with the address in the footer.
- Open a Getly account, create the product listing with crypto checkout, and paste the same TRC-20 payout address so store sales land in the wallet already being monitored; verify current fee and payout terms before listing.
- If the product is an extension, pay the one-time $5 Chrome Web Store registration and publish the free version with an in-tool ask pointing to the product page.
- Write one problem-workaround article on the existing dev.to pipeline where the product is the fix, reusing the footer address already appended to every post.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
