# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-07T04:02:57.019838+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The best current route is to build a small digital product once, list it free on every zero-cost channel, and let a storefront that settles stablecoin directly to the owner's own Tron wallet handle the paid tier, while the free tier does the discovery the owner cannot afford. Getly is the strongest fit among the leads: free to list, no monthly fee, crypto payout in USDT on TRC-20 to the seller's own wallet with no KYC for crypto settlement, which reuses the validated receive address this project already publishes. The product itself should be a static, client-side or self-hosted artifact with a zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier costs nothing to run and every incoming payment is margin. The wallet ask, already live on dev.to articles, is duplicated into the README, the product page, and the tool's own output, so users who never open a storefront can still pay. No channel in th

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts; lists a downloadable product and delivers it on sale. | Free to list, no monthly fee; verify current terms for the platform's cut of each sale. | USDT/USDC, TRC-20 supported, paid directly to the seller's own wallet address; no KYC for crypto settlement; minimum payout $15 on Tron (verify current terms). | Create an account, upload the product file, set the price, paste the existing TRC-20 receive address as the payout destination. | The storefront delivers the file to the buyer and settles the stablecoin to the wallet with no owner action per sale. |
| Wallet ask on the product page and README (already live) | No platform at all: a receive address printed beside and inside the artifact. | Zero. No listing fee, no cut, no account. | TRC-20 USDT to the already-validated address; no custodian, no KYC. | None beyond pasting the existing address into the product page, README, and release notes. | Any payment is a direct transfer to the wallet; there is no per-sale work and no platform that can freeze a payout. |
| GitHub repo, FUNDING.yml, and Releases | Hosts the code, the downloadable artifact, and a rendered Sponsor button with a custom URL. | Zero on the free tier; no storefront, listing fee, or approval queue. | The custom: field of FUNDING.yml and the README/release bodies carry the TRC-20 address directly; no platform touches the money. | Add .github/FUNDING.yml with a custom URL, paste the address into the README, attach the built artifact to a release. | The release is downloaded many times from the same upload; the ask travels with every copy and fork. |
| Chrome Web Store | Distribution with real organic discovery for a browser extension. | One-time $5 developer registration per account, no renewal, no per-extension fee, covers up to 20 extensions; the store takes no cut of a free extension. | None; the store lists the free extension and monetisation is the wallet ask or a paid upgrade sold through a storefront. | Pay the one-time $5, upload the extension, wait for review. | The free listing is discovered without owner action; the upgrade and the address carry the income. |
| itch.io | Free-to-publish storefront for tools and asset packs, with pay-what-you-want pricing. | Free to upload, no approval queue; open revenue sharing lets the seller choose the platform's cut, default around 10%. A payout requires a completed tax interview with a TIN and a one-time $3.00 Tax Identity fee. | Fiat only; payout is custodial and identity-gated. Use it as a free listing surface, not as the settlement path. | Create an account, upload the product, set pay-what-you-want pricing, complete the tax interview only if a fiat payout is ever wanted. | Listing and delivery are automated; the identity and fee cost is on the payout side, which this plan routes around by pointing buyers at the wallet address instead. |

## Product Ideas

1. **Single-purpose browser extension for one specific annoyance**
   - Who buys: Users who hit that annoyance daily and already search the Chrome Web Store for a fix.
   - Deliverable: Free extension in the Chrome Web Store; a paid upgrade (extra sites, saved profiles, export) sold through Getly and unlocked with a licence key.
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus one-time licence for the upgrade; wallet ask in the extension's own about page.
   - Cost per extra user: Zero: the extension runs client-side and the store distributes the file.
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store free listing, GitHub repo for source and releases, Getly for the paid file.
2. **Static web tool that runs entirely client-side**
   - Who buys: People who need the conversion, calculation, or cleanup often enough to want a bookmarked, ad-free version with saved settings.
   - Deliverable: A single static page hosted free, with a paid tier that persists profiles or unlocks batch mode; the page itself carries the TRC-20 address.
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus one-time licence; pay-what-you-want on itch.io as an extra listing surface.
   - Cost per extra user: Zero: no server, no backend, no per-user cost.
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages for hosting, the existing GitHub account, Getly for the paid tier.
3. **Template, preset, or asset pack for a tool people already use**
   - Who buys: Users of that tool who want a starting point and will pay to skip building it themselves.
   - Deliverable: A downloadable pack of templates or presets, sold once and delivered by the storefront; a free sample pack on the repo and itch.io.
   - Pricing model: One-time licence on Getly; free sample pack elsewhere as discovery; wallet ask in the pack's README.
   - Cost per extra user: Zero: the file is built once and downloaded many times.
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for the free sample, Getly for the paid pack, itch.io as a second listing.
4. **Self-hostable CLI utility**
   - Who buys: Developers and power users who hit the specific annoyance in their own workflow.
   - Deliverable: A binary or script in GitHub Releases, free to use, with a paid pro tier (extra commands, config sync, priority fixes) delivered as a second release.
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus one-time licence; the address is printed in --help output and the README so it travels with every copy.
   - Cost per extra user: Zero: the buyer runs it on their own machine.
   - Free stack: GitHub repo and Releases, Getly for the pro tier, dev.to article as the discovery path.
5. **Data set or reference compiled once and sold as a download**
   - Who buys: Anyone who needs that reference and would rather pay than compile it.
   - Deliverable: A static file (JSON, CSV, or markdown bundle) sold as a download, with a free subset as the discovery surface.
   - Pricing model: One-time licence on Getly; free subset on GitHub and itch.io; wallet ask in the data's own README.
   - Cost per extra user: Zero: compiled once, copied indefinitely.
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for the free subset, Getly for the full set.

## Next Actions

- Pick the smallest product shape from the list above, build it once, and make sure it runs at zero per-user cost on the free stack already in place.
- Create the Getly account, upload the product, set the price, and paste the existing validated TRC-20 receive address as the payout destination; verify current terms for the platform cut and the $15 Tron minimum before listing.
- Paste the same TRC-20 address into the README, .github/FUNDING.yml as a custom URL, the release notes, and the tool's own --help or about output, so the ask reaches users who never open a storefront.
- List the free tier on every zero-cost channel at once: GitHub Releases, itch.io as a pay-what-you-want listing, and the Chrome Web Store if the product is an extension, accepting the one-time $5 as the only non-zero cost.
- Write the dev.to article about the problem the product solves, with the product as the fix and the existing footer ask, reusing the publishing infrastructure already running.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
