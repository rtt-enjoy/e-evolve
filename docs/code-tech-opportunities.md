# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-09-10T04:53:31.918744+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The lowest-friction path is to ship a free, client-side tool (browser extension, static web tool, or CLI utility) that solves one sharp annoyance, embed the existing Tron (TRC-20) USDT receive address on the product page and in the README, list the same artifact on Getly for direct stablecoin payouts to that wallet, on itch.io for pay-what-you-want fiat reach, and on the Chrome Web Store (one-time $5) for organic extension discovery, then write dev.to articles that frame the problem and point to the product — all infrastructure is already free or one-time, and every sale settles without owner action.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with card and crypto checkout, stablecoin payout to seller's own wallet | Free to list; platform fee verify current terms; minimum payout $15 on Tron ($5 on BSC), network fee ~$0.50-1 on Tron | USDT/USDC on Tron (TRC-20) and BSC (BEP-20) directly to seller's wallet — verify current terms | Create account, connect the existing Tron wallet address, upload product file or licence key, set price | After listing, storefront handles checkout, delivery, and payout; no owner action per sale |
| itch.io | Marketplace for digital tools, assets, and utilities; pay-what-you-want pricing | Free to publish; seller chooses platform cut (default 10%) — verify current terms | Fiat only (PayPal/Stripe) — crypto leg stays the wallet footer; verify current terms | Create account, upload product, set pay-what-you-want or fixed price, choose revenue share | Platform handles payment and file delivery; seller receives periodic fiat payout, wallet address in README captures crypto separately |
| Chrome Web Store | Official distribution for browser extensions with organic search discovery | One-time $5 developer registration (covers up to 20 extensions); no annual fee, no revenue cut on free extensions | None (fiat only via Google Play Billing for paid extensions) — crypto monetisation via wallet address in description | Pay $5 once, prepare extension zip, write store listing, include Tron address in description and support link | Extension installs and updates are automatic; wallet address in listing enables direct crypto tips or upgrade sales without platform |
| Wallet address on product page and README | Direct peer-to-peer stablecoin payments with no intermediary | Zero | USDT on Tron (TRC-20) directly to the owner's wallet — already validated | Add the existing address to the product landing page, GitHub README, Chrome Web Store description, and any documentation | No platform, no fees, no approval; every on-chain transfer is final and requires zero owner involvement |
| dev.to articles (already running) | Content marketing that drives traffic to the product; footer wallet address is appended automatically | Zero (already part of the publishing pipeline) | USDT on Tron (TRC-20) via the same appended address | Write one article per product shaping the problem and linking to the product page; the bot appends the wallet address | Articles stay indexed and generate traffic indefinitely; the wallet address is already in the footer of every post |

## Product Ideas

1. **Single-Tab Tab Manager**
   - Who buys: Developers and power users who drown in tabs and want a one-click 'collapse all but active' button
   - Deliverable: Browser extension (Manifest V3) that adds a toolbar button to instantly collapse all other tabs into a saved session, with a paid upgrade for auto-save, keyboard shortcut, and session naming
   - Pricing model: Free tier: manual collapse button; Paid upgrade: one-time licence key unlocks auto-save, shortcut, naming (delivered via Getly licence key)
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — extension runs entirely client-side, no server
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages for landing page, GitHub Actions for build/zip, Chrome Web Store for distribution, Getly for licence sales
2. **CLI Log Redactor**
   - Who buys: DevOps engineers and SREs who need to strip secrets (API keys, tokens, IPs) from log files before sharing
   - Deliverable: Standalone binary (Go/Rust) or npm package that reads stdin or files, redacts patterns via configurable regex, writes clean output; paid version adds custom rule packs and batch directory processing
   - Pricing model: Free tier: built-in patterns only; Paid upgrade: one-time download of extended rule pack + batch mode (sold on Getly and itch.io)
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — client-side binary, no runtime cost
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for binaries, GitHub Pages for docs, Getly/itch.io for paid downloads
3. **Static Color-Contrast Auditor**
   - Who buys: Designers and frontend developers who must meet WCAG AA/AAA contrast ratios
   - Deliverable: Single HTML file (no build step) that loads a page via URL or pasted HTML, scans all text nodes, reports failing contrast pairs; paid unlock exports CSV, saves project settings, and adds a CI script
   - Pricing model: Free tier: full audit in browser; Paid upgrade: one-time licence for export/CSV and CI script (delivered via Getly)
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — static file hosted on GitHub Pages
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages for tool, GitHub Actions for CI script generation, Getly for licence
4. **Regex Playground Preset Pack**
   - Who buys: Developers who repeatedly write similar regexes (email, URL, UUID, log parsing) and want tested, commented patterns
   - Deliverable: JSON/Markdown preset files for popular regex editors (Regex101, VS Code, Raycast) plus a one-page cheatsheet; sold as a downloadable asset pack
   - Pricing model: Pay-what-you-want on itch.io (minimum $0), fixed price on Getly
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — digital files only
   - Free stack: GitHub repo for source, itch.io and Getly for distribution

## Next Actions

- Pick one product idea above, build the free tier as a client-only artifact (extension, binary, or static HTML) and push to GitHub.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
