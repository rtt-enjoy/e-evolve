# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-09-09T04:52:21.215423+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The lowest-friction path is to ship a free, zero-marginal-cost tool (browser extension, CLI utility, or static web tool) that solves one sharp annoyance, put the existing TRC-20 USDT receive address on the product page and in the README, list the free version on the Chrome Web Store (one-time $5 for up to 20 extensions) for organic discovery, and simultaneously list a paid upgrade on Getly (no monthly fee, direct USDT/USDC on Tron to your wallet, no KYC) and on itch.io (pay-what-you-want, free to publish) for additional reach. All channels require only a one-time manual setup; after that, delivery and crypto settlement are fully automated.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts | Free to list; revenue cut verify current terms | USDT/USDC on Tron (TRC-20) and BNB Smart Chain directly to seller's own wallet, no KYC, no custodian | Create account, connect TRC-20 wallet address, upload product files, set price or license key for upgrade | Buyer pays via card or crypto; Getly delivers the file/license automatically and pushes USDT to the connected wallet on each sale (minimum payout $15 on Tron, network fee ~$0.50-1). No owner action per transaction. |
| itch.io | Marketplace for digital tools, assets, and utilities (not only games) | Free to publish; platform cut default 10% but seller can set 0-100% (verify current terms) | Fiat only (PayPal/Stripe) — no direct crypto payout; serves as reach channel while wallet address handles crypto | Create account, upload product, enable pay-what-you-want pricing, add wallet address in description | Automated delivery of download after payment; seller receives fiat payout on schedule. The crypto leg remains the direct wallet ask. |
| Chrome Web Store | Distribution channel for browser extensions with organic discovery | One-time $5 developer registration fee (covers up to 20 extensions), no annual renewal, no revenue cut on free extensions | None directly; drives users to product page where wallet address is displayed | Pay $5, register developer account, package extension, submit for review, publish free version with link to upgrade page | Once published, the extension is discoverable by millions; updates are pushed by the owner only when desired. No per-sale work. |
| Direct wallet ask (TRC-20 USDT address) | Receive crypto payments with zero platform, zero fees, zero setup beyond displaying address | $0 | USDT on Tron (TRC-20) directly to owner's wallet, no intermediary, no KYC | Ensure the validated receive address is placed on the product landing page, in the README, and in the dev.to article footer (already automated) | User sends USDT to the address; transaction confirms on-chain. Owner never touches the sale. Already live and verified. |
| GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions | Free static hosting and CI for landing pages, documentation, or client-side web tools | $0 (free tier) | N/A — infrastructure only | Create a GitHub repo, enable Pages, add a simple HTML/JS product page, configure Actions for any scheduled tasks | Hosts the product page and any client-side tool at zero marginal cost. No server maintenance, no per-user expense. |

## Product Ideas

1. **CleanFeed — browser extension that hides promoted/irrelevant posts on X (Twitter)**
   - Who buys: Power users of X who want a cleaner timeline without ads or algorithmic noise
   - Deliverable: Free extension (basic keyword/hide rules) + paid upgrade (custom regex filters, cross-device sync via encrypted storage, priority updates)
   - Pricing model: Free tier on Chrome Web Store; one-time license for Pro features sold via Getly (USDT) and itch.io (pay-what-you-want)
   - Cost per extra user: $0 per additional user (client-side only)
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store for distribution, GitHub Pages for landing page, GitHub Actions for build, TRC-20 wallet for crypto
2. **JSON Flattener CLI — single binary that flattens nested JSON into dot-notation keys**
   - Who buys: Backend developers and data engineers who frequently transform JSON for logging or analytics
   - Deliverable: Cross-platform binary (Linux/macOS/Windows) + source; free version flattens stdin to stdout, paid version adds streaming, schema inference, and config file
   - Pricing model: Pay-what-you-want on itch.io (fiat reach) + fixed-price license on Getly (USDT) + direct wallet ask
   - Cost per extra user: $0 (pre-built binaries served via GitHub Releases)
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for downloads, GitHub Pages for docs, Getly/itch.io for sales, TRC-20 wallet

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
