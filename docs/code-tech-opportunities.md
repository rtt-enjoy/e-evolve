# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-13T16:27:30.249202+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The best current route is: build a client-side digital product that costs nothing per user, ship it free through GitHub Releases and Chrome Web Store, and collect via a paid upgrade or honest ask settled in TRC-20 USDT directly to the wallet address already in use. Getly is the one storefront found that lists free, pays stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet with no KYC and no monthly fee; the wallet-ask channel (product page, README, FUNDING.yml, --help output, dev.to footers) needs no account at all and is already live. Avoid Sellix (seized 2024) and itch.io payouts (require tax interview/TIN). The only hard cost in the whole stack is Chrome Web Store's one-time $5 developer fee.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts | No monthly/listing fee; platform cut — verify current terms; buyer-side card payments via Stripe | USDT/USDC direct to seller's own wallet; TRC-20 supported. Min payout $15 on Tron ($5 on BNB Smart Chain); verify current terms | One-time signup, product listing, and entering the existing Tron receive address as payout destination | Storefront handles delivery and payment; owner action per sale is zero — payouts settle to the existing wallet |
| Wallet ask (already live) | Receive address published on product page, README, FUNDING.yml, --help and dev.to footers | Zero — reuses the validated address the project already appends to every article | USDT TRC-20 direct to own wallet; no custodian, no KYC, no account | Paste the address into README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom: field, --help/about output, and the product page once | A user pays directly on-chain; nothing to fulfil, nothing to process |
| GitHub Releases | Free hosting of product binaries, archives and downloads | Zero; no platform cut | N/A — pair with the wallet ask in release notes and README | Create a release with the built artifact and payment line, once per version | Downloads and storage are GitHub's; nothing per user to do |
| Chrome Web Store | Distribution with real organic discovery for browser extensions | One-time $5 developer registration covering up to 20 extensions; no renewal, no per-extension fee, no cut on free extensions | N/A — the store doesn't pay; monetise via the wallet ask or a paid upgrade sold on Getly | Pay $5, register, submit the extension for review (one-time) | The store delivers updates and handles discovery; paid conversions happen off-store via the wallet or Getly |
| dev.to articles (already running) | Problem-workaround articles whose footer carries the product link and receive address | Zero — infrastructure already paid for | USDT TRC-20 to own wallet via the existing footer address | Write one article positioning the product as the fix | The back catalogue keeps sending readers to the product and the ask indefinitely |

## Product Ideas

1. **Browser extension solving one specific annoyance (e.g. blocking one annoying UI pattern on one popular site)**
   - Who buys: Users of that site who hit the annoyance daily and search the Chrome Web Store for a fix
   - Deliverable: Extension install (free) plus a licence key unlocking the paid tier of one storefront
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid upgrade via Getly, plus wallet ask in the extension's about/options page
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — extension runs client-side; no server
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store distribution, GitHub for source and issues, Getly for paid tier
2. **Single-purpose CLI utility published on GitHub Releases**
   - Who buys: Developers with the exact recurring task the tool automates
   - Deliverable: Free binary download; paid tier is a convenience pack (config presets, batch mode) unlocked by licence or simply an honest-ask in --help
   - Pricing model: Freemium with wallet ask in README and --help; optional Getly listing for the paid tier
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — binary runs on the buyer's machine
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases hosting, GitHub Pages for docs, dev.to article for reach
3. **Template/preset/asset pack for a tool people already use**
   - Who buys: Users of that tool who want the result without building it themselves
   - Deliverable: A one-time downloadable file pack, delivered by the storefront
   - Pricing model: One-time licence / pay-what-you-want with the Tron address as one payment option
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — built once, downloaded many times
   - Free stack: Getly (free listing) + GitHub Releases mirror + repo README ask
4. **Static client-side web tool on GitHub Pages**
   - Who buys: Anyone searching for that one conversion/calculation/generation task
   - Deliverable: Free tool; paid tier is an offline/pro/batch version sold as a download
   - Pricing model: Freemium; wallet ask on the page footer
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — all computation is in the browser
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages (free tier already in use), README ask, dev.to article

## Next Actions

- Pick one product shape (extension or CLI utility), build it client-side so marginal cost is zero, and ship the free tier on GitHub Releases with the existing Tron address in the README, FUNDING.yml and --help output
- Sign up on Getly by hand, list the paid tier, and set the payout wallet to the existing TRC-20 address; verify current payout minimums and fees before listing
- If the product is an extension, pay the one-time $5 Chrome Web Store registration and submit the extension — the only non-zero cost in the stack
- Write one problem-workaround article on dev.to (the shape that outperforms ~25x on this account) where the product is the fix and the existing footer is the ask
- Embed the receive address in the artifact itself (about screen, --help, docs footer) so every copy and fork carries a payment path with no owner action

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
