# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-12T13:16:32.786393+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The cheapest passive route is to build the product once as a client-side tool or downloadable asset, ship it free for discovery, and monetize through a wallet ask plus a paid upgrade. The validated Tron (TRC-20) USDT receive address already appended to dev.to articles should be reused on the product page, README, --help output, and GitHub FUNDING.yml, so payment needs no platform, no KYC, and no owner action. Getly is the one storefront found that settles USDT on Tron directly to the seller's wallet with no monthly fee and no KYC for crypto payout (verify current terms before relying on it). GitHub Releases hosts the artifact free; the Chrome Web Store is the only non-zero cost (one-time $5) if the product is an extension. Real revenue is whatever lands on-chain.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Published receive address (wallet ask) | Direct USDT payments on Tron to the owner's own wallet, no intermediary | Zero; already validated and appended to dev.to articles | USDT TRC-20 directly to the owner's wallet, non-custodial, no KYC | Paste the address into product page, README, FUNDING.yml, release notes, and the tool's about/--help output (one-time) | A sale is just a user sending USDT; the owner reads the on-chain balance and ships nothing per transaction |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with card and crypto checkout, stablecoin payouts | No monthly fee per available listing; minimum payout ~$15 on Tron (~$5 on BNB Chain) and network fee — verify current terms | USDT/USDC to the seller's own wallet, TRC-20 supported, no KYC for crypto settlement — verify current terms | One-time manual signup, product listing, and payout-address configuration | Storefront handles checkout and license delivery automatically; no owner action per sale |
| GitHub Releases + FUNDING.yml + README | Free hosting for binaries/archives and a Sponsor button rendered from the repo itself | Zero; uses the existing GitHub account | None from GitHub itself — payments arrive via the published TRC-20 USDT address in FUNDING.yml custom field, README, and release notes | Add .github/FUNDING.yml with the custom wallet URL, upload the artifact to a Release, paste the address into README once | Downloads are automated by GitHub; any payment is a direct on-chain transfer, nothing to fulfil |
| Chrome Web Store | Distribution and organic search for browser extensions | One-time $5 developer registration fee; no annual renewal, covers up to 20 extensions, no cut on free extensions | None — the store distributes free; monetization is the wallet ask in the extension or a paid upgrade sold via Getly/wallet address | One-time $5 payment (needs a card), packaging and submission of the extension | Store handles installs and updates; income arrives via the wallet ask or upgrade, not per-sale work |
| itch.io | Storefront listing tools and digital assets, free upload, pay-what-you-want | Free to upload; seller chooses revenue share (default ~10%); one-time $3 tax-identity fee — verify current terms | None — fiat payout only, and it requires a completed tax interview with a TIN; disqualified if the owner wants KYC-free crypto settlement | One-time upload plus tax interview if pursued | Storefront delivers downloads automatically; listed only as a reach multiplier if KYC is acceptable |
| dev.to article footer (already live) | Content marketing running on existing publishing infrastructure | Zero | USDT TRC-20 to the already-published receive address | None beyond writing; bot already publishes daily | Back-catalogue articles keep converting readers long after publication |

## Product Ideas

1. **One-annoyance browser extension with paid unlock**
   - Who buys: Users searching the Chrome Web Store for a fix to one specific irritation (e.g., a site quirk, tab clutter, a broken workflow)
   - Deliverable: Free extension install; a licence/upgrade (extra features, no limits) unlocked after USDT payment to the published address
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus one-time paid upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Zero per user; the extension runs client-side
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store listing ($5 one-time), GitHub for source and issues, wallet address in the extension's about page
2. **Single-purpose CLI utility distributed via GitHub Releases**
   - Who buys: Developers and power users hitting a repetitive task the tool automates
   - Deliverable: Downloadable binary/archive from GitHub Releases; paid tier adds extra commands or output formats
   - Pricing model: Free core, paid pro commands via wallet ask in README and --help
   - Cost per extra user: Zero; buyers run it on their own machines
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases hosting, GitHub Actions for CI builds, FUNDING.yml + README wallet address
3. **Asset pack / template bundle for a popular tool**
   - Who buys: Users of an existing tool (theme, preset, snippet, config pack) who want a curated starting point
   - Deliverable: A zip download of the pack, listed on Getly and GitHub Releases
   - Pricing model: One-time licence or pay-what-you-want
   - Cost per extra user: Zero; built once, downloaded many times
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for hosting, Getly for card buyers, wallet address for direct USDT
4. **Static client-side web tool**
   - Who buys: Anyone Googling for the specific conversion/calculation/formatting job it does
   - Deliverable: Free public tool on GitHub Pages; paid offline/licence-free copy or pro features via USDT payment
   - Pricing model: Free web version, one-time paid download of the pro version
   - Cost per extra user: Zero; GitHub Pages free tier, no server
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions if any build step, wallet address in the footer

## Next Actions

- Pick one product shape (extension, CLI, or asset pack), build it fully client-side so marginal cost is zero, and host the artifact on GitHub Releases of the existing account.
- Paste the validated TRC-20 USDT receive address into the README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, release notes, and the tool's own about/--help output so every copy carries the ask.
- Create a Getly listing for the paid tier or asset pack, configure USDT TRC-20 payout to the same wallet, and verify current payout minimums and terms before launch.
- If the product is a browser extension, pay the one-time $5 Chrome Web Store registration to get organic discovery, and put the wallet ask inside the extension's about panel.
- Write a dev.to article about the problem the product solves, with the product link and the existing wallet footer, so the already-running publishing pipeline does the marketing.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
