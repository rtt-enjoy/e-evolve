# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-13T13:01:25.605969+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The strongest zero-budget route is a client-side digital product (extension or utility) built once and paid for via the already-validated TRC-20 USDT receive address, placed everywhere money can meet the user: README, FUNDING.yml, product page, --help output, and dev.to article footers that are already publishing daily. For storefront-style sales with card AND crypto payment, Getly is the one platform in these leads that settles stablecoin directly to the seller's own wallet with no KYC and no monthly fee; it should be verified live before signup. Chrome Web Store distribution ($5 one-time, the only non-zero cost) gives a browser extension real organic discovery that a free tier converts into paid upgrades. Every sale - storefront or direct wallet ask - is delivered and paid with zero owner action per unit.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wallet ask (already live): product page, README, FUNDING.yml, --help, dev.to footers | Direct USDT payment on Tron to the owner's own validated address | $0, no platform, no cut | USDT TRC-20 directly to the owner's wallet; already validated and running on every published article | None new - paste the same address into the README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, product page, and the tool's --help/about output | Payment is a wallet transfer the buyer makes alone; delivery is a public download; nothing per sale |
| Getly (getly.store) | Digital-goods storefront; buyers pay by card or crypto, seller paid in stablecoin | No monthly fee; minimum payout ~$15 on Tron (~$5 on BNB Smart Chain), network fee ~$0.50-1 on Tron - verify current terms | USDT/USDC to the seller's own wallet address, TRC-20 supported, stated no KYC for crypto settlement - verify current terms | One manual signup: create account, add wallet address, create product listing, set price | Storefront handles checkout and delivery of the download/licence; owner does nothing per sale |
| GitHub Releases | Free hosting of the product binaries/archives plus release notes carrying the ask | $0 - same account that already hosts the code; no listing fee, no approval queue, no identity check | N/A - payment is the wallet ask in release notes and README | One-time: tag a release, upload the artifact, paste the receive address into the release body, README, and FUNDING.yml | Downloads serve themselves forever; an unenforced ask trades conversion for zero cost and zero platform that can freeze funds |
| Chrome Web Store | Distribution with real organic discovery for browser extensions | One-time $5 developer registration covering up to 20 extensions; no renewal, no per-extension fee, no cut of a free extension - the only non-zero cost on this table | N/A - monetise via the free tier linking out to Getly or the wallet ask | One-time: pay the $5 registration, package the extension, submit for review | Store listing surfaces the extension to organic search indefinitely; free tier funnels users to paid upgrade |
| itch.io | Free uploads of tools and asset packs, pay-what-you-want supported | Free to publish, revenue share default ~10% - but payout requires a tax interview with a TIN and a one-time $3 identity fee, so it conflicts with the no-KYC constraint | Fiat only; no stablecoin payout | Upload, set price, complete tax interview if payout wanted | Listings are permanent and self-serve, but flag it as fiat/KYC - publish here only if the owner accepts identity verification, otherwise skip |

## Product Ideas

1. **One-annoyance browser extension**
   - Who buys: Users hitting the same daily friction (e.g. a site quirk, a tab/clipboard annoyance) who find it via Chrome Web Store search
   - Deliverable: Free extension in the store; paid tier unlocks pro options via a licence file bought on Getly or paid to the wallet address
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: $0 - runs entirely client-side, no server
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store listing, GitHub repo for source, GitHub Pages for the landing page
2. **Single-purpose CLI utility**
   - Who buys: Developers searching GitHub for exactly this one job
   - Deliverable: Binary/archive on GitHub Releases, free; licence key or pro build for paying users
   - Pricing model: Pay-what-you-want via wallet ask in README/--help, plus one-time licence option on Getly
   - Cost per extra user: $0 - buyer runs it on their own machine
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases hosting, GitHub Actions for build automation on free tier
3. **Template/preset/asset pack**
   - Who buys: Users of an existing popular tool who want a ready-made config, theme, or asset set
   - Deliverable: One downloadable file or archive, delivered by the storefront automatically
   - Pricing model: One-time licence per download
   - Cost per extra user: $0 - built once, downloaded many times
   - Free stack: Getly storefront for enforced sales; GitHub Releases for the free-sample-plus-ask variant
4. **Client-side static web tool**
   - Who buys: Anyone with the problem the tool solves, arriving from an article
   - Deliverable: The working tool is free on GitHub Pages; paid version is a downloadable offline/pro copy or licence
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: $0 - static files, no backend
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages, GitHub repo, dev.to article funnel already publishing daily

## Next Actions

- Paste the validated TRC-20 USDT address into the product's README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, product landing page, and the tool's --help/about output so every copy and fork carries a payment path
- Build the product client-side (extension or CLI) with a free tier and a paid upgrade, hosted on GitHub Releases, so serving users costs $0
- Verify Getly's current terms live (minimum payout, TRC-20 support, no-KYC claim) and, if intact, create one listing for the paid tier there
- If the product is an extension and the owner can spare $5 once, register on Chrome Web Store and submit the free tier for organic discovery; monetise via Getly or the wallet ask
- Write one problem-workaround dev.to article whose fix is the product - the article funnel and wallet footer already run daily, so this is the marketing channel with no new cost

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
