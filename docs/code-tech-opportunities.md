# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-12T01:00:24.486101+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The strongest zero-budget route is: build a single-purpose client-side tool (or asset pack), ship the free tier on GitHub Releases and the Chrome Web Store, and monetize with a paid upgrade / honest-wallet ask — the validated Tron (TRC-20) USDT receive address already attached to every dev.to article goes in the README, FUNDING.yml, --help output, and product page so payment needs no storefront, no custodian, and no per-sale owner work. The only crypto-friendly storefront identified with direct-to-own-wallet settlement is Getly (USDT on Tron, no KYC for crypto payout), which should be verified before relying on it. Revenue is read from the on-chain balance only — no revenue estimate is possible or offered.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wallet ask (product page, README, FUNDING.yml, --help, docs footer) — already live | Direct stablecoin payment from buyer to the owner's own Tron wallet | Zero. Address already validated and appended to every dev.to article | USDT (TRC-20) directly to the owner's own wallet; no custodian, no KYC, no settlement delay | Paste the existing address into the product page, README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, and --help/about output of each tool | Payment is self-serve; each sale is just an on-chain transfer with zero owner action |
| GitHub Releases | Free hosting and distribution of binaries, archives, and download pages on the existing repo account | Zero; no listing fee, no revenue cut, no approval queue | None from the platform — pair with the wallet ask in the release notes and README | One-time: tag a release and upload the built artifact; release body carries the address | Downloads are self-serve forever; nothing per sale to do |
| Chrome Web Store | The main discovery surface for browser extensions | One-time $5 developer registration per account, covering up to 20 extensions; no renewal, no cut of free extensions. This is the only non-zero cost and is stated because zero budget is binding — if $5 is unavailable, distribute the extension via GitHub Releases instead | None from the store (card only for paid listings) — monetize via wallet ask or a paid upgrade sold on a crypto-settling storefront | One-time: register, upload the extension, pass review; a paid-upgrade landing page links out | Store handles distribution, updates, and reviews; income arrives via the wallet, not the store |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts and card checkout | Verify current terms. Reported as no monthly fee; minimum payout ~$15 on Tron; Tron network fee roughly $0.50–1 — verify current terms before relying on any figure | USDT on Tron (TRC-20) reported, paid directly to the seller's own wallet, no KYC for crypto settlement — verify current terms | One-time: create account, list the product, paste the payout wallet address | Storefront handles checkout and delivery; payouts sweep to the owner's wallet without owner action |
| itch.io | Free digital storefront listing tools and asset packs, pay-what-you-want supported | Free to upload; seller chooses the platform cut (default ~10%) — verify current terms. Payout requires a completed tax interview with a TIN (SSN/EIN/ITIN or local equivalent) and a one-time $3.00 tax identity fee | None — fiat payout only, and identity-gated. Included only for completeness; it fails the no-KYC preference and is optional | One-time: upload, set price, complete tax interview before any payout is possible | Storefront delivers each sale automatically once listed |

## Product Ideas

1. **One-annoyance browser extension**
   - Who buys: Users plagued by one specific site behavior (e.g., a nag overlay, forced login wall, cluttered layout)
   - Deliverable: Free extension in the Chrome Web Store; paid tier unlocks extra rules/settings, delivered as a licence download via Getly or wallet ask
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid one-time upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — the extension runs client-side
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store ($5 one-time) or GitHub Releases; wallet ask in the extension's about output
2. **Asset/preset pack for a tool people already use**
   - Who buys: Users of a popular tool (editor themes, automation presets, config packs) who want a curated set now
   - Deliverable: Downloadable pack from GitHub Releases; paid version via Getly listing or the receive address in the README
   - Pricing model: One-time licence, or pay-what-you-want with the wallet address as the payment rail
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — a file built once, copied infinitely
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases hosting, README + FUNDING.yml payment, article on dev.to as the discovery piece
3. **Static client-side web tool**
   - Who buys: People searching for a fix to one conversion/inspection/scrubbing task
   - Deliverable: Free tool on GitHub Pages; paid offline/CLI version or extended feature set sold as a download
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid upgrade, one-time licence
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — no server; GitHub Pages free tier
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions; receive address in the page footer
4. **Self-hostable script / CLI utility**
   - Who buys: Developers who need one narrow job done on their own machine
   - Deliverable: Public repo with Releases; --help and docs footer carry the wallet address
   - Pricing model: Honest ask / pay-what-you-want via the receive address
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — buyer runs it on their own machine
   - Free stack: GitHub (repo, Releases, FUNDING.yml); dev.to article as the discovery engine

## Next Actions

- Pick one product shape (extension or asset pack) and build the free tier so it runs entirely client-side at zero marginal cost.
- Paste the existing validated Tron (TRC-20) receive address into the README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, every GitHub Release body, the product page, and the tool's --help/about output.
- Publish the artifact on GitHub Releases today (zero cost, zero identity checks) as the baseline distribution.
- Manually verify Getly's current payout terms (Tron USDT support, minimum payout, fees, no-KYC status) before listing; then create the listing once.
- Decide whether the one-time $5 Chrome Web Store fee is affordable; if not, distribute the extension via GitHub Releases and rely on the dev.to article as discovery.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
