# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-02T03:57:05.282220+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The best zero-budget route is to build the product once on a stack that costs nothing per user (static client-side page, browser extension, or a downloadable file on GitHub Releases), then let free channels do discovery while the money arrives either through a non-custodial stablecoin storefront or through the Tron receive address the project already publishes. The strongest pattern in the leads is 'ship the tool free, sell the upgrade, ask in the artifact': the free tier buys the discovery the owner cannot afford, the paid upgrade or licence is the price, and the same validated TRC-20 address printed in the README, in --help output, and on the product page takes payment from users who never open a storefront at all. Every channel below is free to list on except the Chrome Web Store's one-time $5, and every payout path either settles USDT on Tron to the owner's own wallet or is flagged w

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct wallet ask (no platform — already live) | The validated TRC-20 receive address, printed on the product page, in the README, in --help output and in release notes, so a user can pay with no storefront in the path at all. | Zero. No listing fee, no cut, no account, no KYC. | USDT on Tron (TRC-20), straight to the wallet the project already uses; on-chain balance is the only revenue record. | None new — the address is already appended to every published article; copy the same string into the new surfaces. | Payment needs no owner action, no intermediary, and no per-sale step; the address is a static string that works while nobody is online. |
| GitHub repo, Releases and FUNDING.yml | Hosts the code, the downloadable binaries/archives, and a rendered Sponsor button whose custom: field takes an arbitrary URL — no GitHub Sponsors enrolment, no Stripe Connect, no W-9. | Free tier; no listing fee, no approval queue, no identity check, no cut of anything. | Whatever the custom URL points to — point it at the product page that carries the Tron address, so payout is USDT (TRC-20) to the owner's own wallet. | One-time: add .github/FUNDING.yml with a custom: URL, paste the address into the README, and attach it to each release body. | Releases are static files downloaded any number of times with no owner action; the ask is embedded in the artifact itself. |
| Getly storefront (verify current terms) | Digital-goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts: buyers pay by card or crypto, the seller is settled in USDT/USDC to their own wallet address. | Per the lead: no monthly fee; minimum payout $15 on Tron ($5 on BNB Smart Chain) with a network fee of roughly $0.50–1 on Tron. I am not certain of the service's current status or fee schedule — verify current terms before relying on it. | USDT/USDC including TRC-20, directly to the seller's own wallet, no KYC for crypto settlement per the lead — verify current terms. | One-time signup, one product listing, and entering the same Tron receive address as the payout destination. | The storefront delivers the download and settles the payout per sale; the owner does nothing between listing and withdrawal. |
| itch.io (free-to-publish listing) | Free-to-upload storefront with no approval queue and no upfront fee that lists tools and assets, not only games; supports pay-what-you-want pricing. | Free to publish; open revenue sharing lets the seller choose the platform's cut (default around 10%). Being paid is not identity-free: a payout requires a completed tax interview with a TIN and a one-time $3.00 Tax Identity verification fee. | Fiat only, custodial, KYC-required for payout — so use itch.io as a free discovery surface and put the Tron address in the listing and in the downloadable itself; do not treat it as the crypto payout path. | One-time account creation, one product page, one upload. | The download is delivered automatically; the listing keeps working after publication with no per-sale owner action. |
| Chrome Web Store (only if the product is an extension) | The distribution channel with real organic discovery for a browser extension. | One-time $5 developer registration per account, no annual renewal, no per-extension fee, covers up to 20 extensions; the store takes no cut of a free extension. This is the only non-zero cost on the table — on a strict zero budget it is optional, and the extension can ship on GitHub Releases with a | None — the store takes no cut of a free extension; monetisation is the wallet ask or a paid upgrade sold through another channel. | One-time $5 registration, one upload, one listing. | A free extension is distributed and updated by the store with no per-install owner action. |

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
