# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-06T18:01:19.379198+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The best zero-budget route is to build the product once, list it free on a storefront that settles stablecoin to the owner's own Tron wallet (Getly is the one verified lead matching that), and in parallel publish the artifact free on GitHub Releases, Firefox Add-ons, and itch.io with the already-validated TRC-20 USDT address printed in the README, the --help output, and the product page. That gives two independent receive paths: an enforced paywall on the storefront and an unenforced wallet ask that travels with every copy. Nothing in the stack has a monthly fee, nothing is custodial, and no sale requires the owner to do anything — the artifact is already built, and delivery is automatic or not needed at all.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts; buyers pay by card or crypto, seller is paid in USDT/USDC | No monthly fee; per-sale fee and exact revenue cut — verify current terms | USDT/USDC including TRC-20, directly to the seller's own wallet, no KYC for crypto settlement; minimum payout $15 on Tron per the lead — verify current terms | Create an account, upload the product file, set a price, paste the existing Tron receive address as the payout destination | Delivery and settlement are both automatic: the buyer pays, the platform hands them the file, and the stablecoin lands on-chain in the wallet the project already reads |
| Wallet ask on the product page, README, --help, and FUNDING.yml (already live) | Direct on-chain payment to the owner's address with no platform in the path at all | Zero — no listing fee, no cut, no account | TRC-20 USDT to the already-validated receive address; the same network and asset the project already publishes | Paste the existing address into the README, the product page, .github/FUNDING.yml (custom: field), and the tool's --help / about output — one copy-paste per surface | The address is printed once and travels with every download, fork, and article; a payment needs no owner action and no intermediary that could freeze or seize it |
| GitHub Releases | Free hosting of binaries, archives, and versioned downloads with no storefront, listing fee, or approval queue | Zero; GitHub takes no cut | None built in — this channel pairs with the wallet ask in the release notes | Tag a release and attach the build; add the receive address and an honest price to the release body | The file is served by GitHub's infrastructure at no cost and no per-download action; the ask is unenforced by design, trading conversion rate for zero platform risk |
| Firefox Add-ons (AMO) | Distribution with real organic discovery for a browser extension, free to publish | Zero to list; no per-extension fee and no cut of a free add-on | None built in — monetisation is the wallet ask in the extension's own about page or a paid upgrade listed elsewhere | Sign the add-on once with Mozilla's web-ext tool and submit; one-time review | The free extension is the discovery channel; the upgrade is sold on Getly and the address rides inside the extension itself |
| Chrome Web Store | The largest organic discovery surface for a browser extension | One-time $5 developer registration per account, no renewal, covers up to 20 extensions, no cut of a free extension — the only non-zero cost on this list | None built in — same wallet-ask and storefront-upgrade model | Pay the one-time $5, upload the extension, complete the one-time listing | Free extension discovery with no per-sale work; the paid tier is delivered by Getly, not by the store |
| itch.io | Free-to-upload storefront for tools and asset packs, not only games, with pay-what-you-want pricing | Free to publish; open revenue sharing lets the seller choose the platform cut (default around 10%) | Fiat only, and a payout requires a completed tax interview with a TIN plus a one-time $3 Tax Identity fee — use it as a listing surface, not the receive path | Create an account, upload the product, set pay-what-you-want with a $0 floor | Upload once; download and delivery are automatic, so it costs nothing per user even if the payout path is never used |
| BTCPay Server (self-hosted) | Self-hosted crypto payment processor: the buyer pays directly to the owner's own wallet, no intermediary holds funds | Software is free and open source; no platform fee and no revenue cut; hosting is the owner's own machine or a free host — verify any third-party host's current terms | Direct to the owner's own wallet, including stablecoins on supported networks — verify current coin and network support | Install and run the server once, generate an invoice page or payment button, link it from the product page | After the one-time install, every invoice is generated automatically and every payment settles on-chain to the owner's address with no custodian and no per-sale action |

## Product Ideas

1. **Single-purpose browser extension that fixes one annoyance**
   - Who buys: Power users of a specific site or workflow who hit that one annoyance daily and already searched for a fix
   - Deliverable: Free extension on Firefox and Chrome; the paid upgrade is a licence key or unlocked feature set delivered automatically by Getly
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus one-time paid upgrade; TRC-20 address in the extension's about page for direct payments
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — the extension runs client-side; each new user costs nothing to serve
   - Free stack: Firefox AMO (free), Chrome Web Store ($5 one-time), GitHub Releases for the packed .xpi, GitHub Pages for the landing page
2. **Static client-side web tool that needs no server**
   - Who buys: People who hit the problem occasionally and want a bookmarkable fix with no signup
   - Deliverable: A single static page that runs entirely in the browser, plus a downloadable version for offline use
   - Pricing model: Free tool with a paid pro tier (batch mode, saved presets, no size limit) sold on Getly; wallet ask in the page footer
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — all computation happens in the visitor's browser
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages for hosting, the existing GitHub account, Getly for the paid tier
3. **Template, preset, or asset pack for a tool people already use**
   - Who buys: Users of that tool who want the result without building the config themselves

   - Cost per extra user: Zero — the pack is built once and copied infinitely
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for a free sample pack, Getly and itch.io for the paid full pack
4. **CLI utility that does one job a built-in tool does badly**
   - Who buys: Developers and sysadmins who would rather pay $10 than write and debug the script themselves
   - Deliverable: A single binary or script per platform, hosted on GitHub Releases with a paid pro build on Getly
   - Pricing model: Free community build with an honest ask in --help; paid build with extra features as a one-time licence
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — the buyer runs it on their own machine
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases, GitHub Actions free tier to build the binaries automatically on a tag, the existing TRC-20 address in --help output
5. **Compiled data set or reference sold as a download**
   - Who buys: Anyone who needs that reference in a usable form and does not want to scrape and clean it themselves
   - Deliverable: A static JSON/CSV/markdown bundle, delivered as an automatic download
   - Pricing model: One-time licence on Getly, pay-what-you-want on itch.io, free sample with the address attached on GitHub Releases
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — the data is compiled once
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for the sample, Getly and itch.io for the full set, GitHub Pages for the preview

## Next Actions

- Pick the smallest product shape from the list and build it once — one annoyance, one tool, one pack. The artifact is the only thing that has to exist; every channel after that is a listing.
- Paste the already-validated TRC-20 receive address into every surface the product touches: README, .github/FUNDING.yml as a custom URL, the product page, and the tool's own --help or about output, so the ask travels with every copy.
- Create a Getly account, upload the paid tier, set the price, and point the payout at the existing Tron address — this is the only storefront in the set that settles stablecoin to the owner's own wallet with no KYC.
- List the free tier on every zero-cost channel at once: GitHub Releases, Firefox Add-ons (free), itch.io (free, pay-what-you-want with a $0 floor), and Chrome Web Store if the one-time $5 is acceptable.
- Write the dev.to article about the problem the product solves, with the product as the fix and the existing footer as the ask — this reuses publishing infrastructure already running and costs nothing.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
