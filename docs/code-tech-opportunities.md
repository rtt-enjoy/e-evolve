# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-09-26T08:21:45.641659+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The owner already has a validated Tron (TRC-20) USDT receive address appended to every dev.to article. The lowest-friction path to passive income is to build a single-purpose digital product (browser extension, CLI utility, or static web tool) that costs nothing per user to run, distribute the free tier via Chrome Web Store (one-time $5) and GitHub Releases, embed the same Tron address in the product's README, --help output, and GitHub FUNDING.yml, and optionally list a paid upgrade on Getly for automated USDT settlement to the same wallet. This requires only one-time setup per channel and no per-sale owner action.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly | Digital goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts | verify current terms | USDT/USDC on Tron (TRC-20) and BSC (BEP-20) to own wallet | Create account, add product, set price, paste Tron receive address | After setup, storefront handles delivery and payout automatically; no owner action per sale |

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Free AI Focus Areas

- free-tier LLM APIs with no credit card requirement
- free speech-to-text, TTS, and transcription APIs
- free image generation and background-removal APIs
- free OCR, document parsing, and PDF extraction APIs
- free embedding and vector-search tiers
- free translation and summarization APIs
- free AI hosting, inference, and scheduled-compute tiers
- open-weight models that run on free CPU/GPU allowances

## Reference Sources

- [15 High-Paying Remote Jobs With a 4-Hour Work Week](https://freedium-mirror.cfd/https://medium.com/@startup_Ideas/15-high-paying-remote-jobs-with-a-4-hour-work-week-and-how-people-actually-get-them-7e8d3562ff99): The viable path is not easy money; it is rare skill, specialization, automation, retainers, async work, and results-based delivery.
- [OpenRouter free model list](https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0): Free (:free) models are capped at 20 req/min and only 50 req/day unless the account has ever purchased $10 in credits (then 1,000/day) -- verify current limit before relying on volume.
- [Google AI Studio (Gemini API)](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey): No credit card required. Gemini 2.5 Flash free tier is roughly 1,500 requests/day; much higher daily ceiling than OpenRouter's free chain -- verify current limit.
- [Cerebras Cloud free tier](https://cloud.cerebras.ai/): No credit card required. Roughly 1M tokens/day and 14,400 requests/day per model -- verify current limit.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
