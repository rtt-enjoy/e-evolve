# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-09-18T00:48:07.157994+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

Create a simple browser extension or utility that solves one specific daily annoyance, ship it free to drive discovery, and monetize through a freemium model where buyers pay for advanced features via direct USDT/USDC wallets using verified zero-knowledge platforms like Getly or GitHub Releases.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly | Storefront for digital goods with native Tron (TRC-20) USDT support and direct wallet payouts | No monthly listing fee; minimum payout $15 on Tron ($5 on BSC); no KYC required | USDT/USDC settled directly to your own wallet address | Create a Getly account, verify email, add your Tron (TRC-20) receive address to the dashboard, and configure the product listing with your price and description. | Once the product is listed, sales generate USDT/USDC directly to your wallet with no per-transaction fees or ongoing management. |
| GitHub Releases | Host the final binary or archive for free with no listing fee and direct crypto payouts | Free to create and upload releases; no per-item listing fee | USDT/USDC paid directly to your own wallet address | Push the packaged product to a GitHub repository, create a release with the binary/zip file, and embed the Tron (TRC-20) receive address in the README and release notes. | Users download the free version and can opt-in to pay for upgrades via the wallet ask in the README—no platform intervention needed. |
| Dev.to (article + wallet ask) | Publish educational content about the problem your product solves, embedding the wallet address for direct crypto donations | Free publishing; no listing fee | USDT/USDC sent directly to your wallet | Write a blog post explaining the annoyance and solution, append your validated Tron (TRC-20) receive address in the footer and README, and link to the GitHub Release for purchase. | Content continues to attract traffic over time; each reader who decides to pay does so directly from their wallet without any platform taking a cut. |

## Product Ideas

1. **FocusBlock**
   - Who buys: Remote workers, students, and knowledge workers who struggle with distraction
   - Deliverable: A browser extension that automatically blocks selected distracting websites (e.g., social media, news) when a timer starts, with optional custom schedule settings
   - Pricing model: Free tier includes blocking 2 sites for 30-minute intervals; paid upgrade ($8/month or one-time $12) adds unlimited site blocking and personalized schedule templates
   - Cost per extra user: Near zero—once the code is written, serving additional users requires only hosting storage on GitHub Releases (free).
   - Free stack: Browser extension built with Manifest V3, hosted on GitHub Pages; binary distributed via GitHub Releases; documentation and wallet ask in README.
2. **QuickClean**
   - Who buys: Small business owners and individual developers who need fast file organization
   - Deliverable: A command-line utility (CLI) that scans a folder and organizes files into folders by type (images, documents, scripts) with a single command
   - Pricing model: Free CLI version that moves files locally; paid subscription ($5/month or one-time $20) adds cloud sync and automated cleanup jobs
   - Cost per extra user: Minimal—runs locally on the user's machine, no server costs; hosted source code on GitHub for discoverability.
   - Free stack: Python-based CLI package, released as source on GitHub, installed via pip or shell script.

## Next Actions

- Write the core product code (browser extension or CLI tool) — this is a one-time development effort with no recurring cost.
- Create a simple landing page with a README that includes your validated Tron (TRC-20) receive address (already used in previous articles) and explains the problem your product solves.
- Set up a Getly account, add your Tron (TRC-20) receive address to the dashboard, and create a product listing with your free tier description and paid upgrade pricing.
- Package the finished product as a standalone binary or zip file and upload it to GitHub Releases, linking the release to the Getly storefront.
- Add a prominent wallet ask in the README and on the product page directing users to send USDT/USDC directly to your wallet for the paid upgrade.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Free AI Focus Areas

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
