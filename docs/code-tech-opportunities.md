# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-09-13T06:22:38.541383+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The most passive route is to create a free digital product (browser extension, CLI utility, or static web tool) that solves a specific annoyance, then monetize through a paid upgrade or license sold via direct Tron USDT wallet address on the product page/README, supplemented by zero-cost listings on itch.io and Getly.store, while leveraging the existing dev.to article infrastructure that already appends the validated receive address.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct wallet address | Takes Tron USDT payments directly to owner's wallet | Zero cost - already live | USDT on Tron to owner's own wallet, no KYC | Add wallet address to product page and README | No platform takes cut, no owner action per sale, payment is verifiable on-chain |
| Getly.store | Digital goods storefront with crypto payment processing | Free to list, verify current terms for payout minimums | USDT/USDC to owner's wallet, Tron (TRC-20) supported | Create account and add product with wallet address for crypto settlement | Buyers pay by card or crypto, payouts go directly to wallet with no KYC for crypto settlement |
| itch.io | Game and software distribution platform | Free to publish, owner sets 0-100% platform cut | Fiat payment, add crypto footer using existing wallet address | Create free developer account and upload product | No approval queue, pay-what-you-want pricing, owner can set 0% cut and add wallet address for crypto payments |
| Chrome Web Store | Browser extension distribution with organic discovery | One-time $5 developer registration fee | Fiat, add wallet footer to extension description | Pay $5 registration fee and submit extension | No per-sale fees, real organic discovery for browser extensions |
| GitHub Pages | Free static hosting for web-based tools | Free tier, no cost | Add wallet address to README and website footer | Push static files to GitHub Pages repo | Zero-cost hosting, no server maintenance, wallet address visible to all visitors |

## Product Ideas

1. **Form Auto-Filler Extension**
   - Who buys: Developers and power users who fill the same forms repeatedly
   - Deliverable: Chrome extension with free tier (fills 3 forms) and paid upgrade (unlimited forms)
   - Pricing model: Free tier + one-time license for paid upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Zero - browser extension runs client-side
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store free tier, GitHub Pages for documentation
2. **Code Snippet Generator CLI**
   - Who buys: Developers who need quick code solutions for common tasks
   - Deliverable: Command-line tool with free tier (5 snippets) and paid upgrade (full library)
   - Pricing model: Free tier + one-time license for paid upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Zero - CLI tool runs locally
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for distribution, GitHub Pages for docs
3. **CSS Utility Generator**
   - Who buys: Frontend developers needing quick CSS solutions
   - Deliverable: Static web tool that generates CSS code client-side
   - Pricing model: Pay-what-you-want download
   - Cost per extra user: Zero - runs entirely in browser
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages hosting, itch.io for downloads
4. **VS Code Theme Pack**
   - Who buys: VS Code users wanting eye-strain reducing themes
   - Deliverable: ZIP file with 10 custom themes
   - Pricing model: One-time license
   - Cost per extra user: Zero - just a file download
   - Free stack: itch.io free publishing, Getly.store listing

## Next Actions

- Build the digital product (choose browser extension, CLI utility, or static web tool) solving one specific annoyance
- Add the validated Tron USDT wallet address to the product page and README
- List the product on itch.io (free) and Getly.store (verify current terms)
- Submit to Chrome Web Store ($5 one-time fee if browser extension)
- Continue publishing problem-solution articles to dev.to where the product is the answer

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Free AI Focus Areas

- free-tier LLM APIs with no credit card requirement
- free speech-to-text, TTS, and transcription APIs
- free image generation and background-removal APIs
- free OCR, document parsing, and PDF extraction APIs
- free embedding and vector-search tiers

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
