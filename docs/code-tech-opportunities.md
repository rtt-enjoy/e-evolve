# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-14T08:19:06.262596+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The best route is a one-time-built digital artifact — an extension, CLI utility, or asset pack — shipped free with a paid upgrade, distributed through zero-cost channels (GitHub Releases + Chrome Web Store), and paid in TRC-20 USDT to the wallet address this project already publishes. Every channel listed is free to set up, settles to the owner's own wallet with no custodian or KYC, and requires no owner action per sale; the only cash cost anywhere in the stack is the one-time $5 Chrome Web Store developer registration.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Releases + README + FUNDING.yml | Free hosting of binaries/archives with a rendered sponsor/pay button | Free; no listing fee, no revenue cut | Direct: buyer sends USDT (TRC-20) to the address printed in README/FUNDING.yml custom field; no platform touches the money | Add address to README, release notes, and .github/FUNDING.yml custom: field (one-time edit on the existing repo) | Buyers download and pay without the owner; nothing can freeze, seize, or geo-block a payout; zero per-sale action |
| Chrome Web Store | Official distribution with organic search discovery for browser extensions | One-time $5 developer registration; covers up to 20 extensions; no revenue cut on free extensions — the only non-zero cost in this stack | None directly; the store is for discovery, monetisation is the wallet ask in the extension's about page and the paid-upgrade link to a storefront | Pay $5 once, register, upload the extension listing | Store search delivers users indefinitely; the ask is embedded in the shipped code |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront selling downloads with native stablecoin payout | No monthly fee, verify current terms on payout minimums and any per-sale cut | USDT on Tron (TRC-20) to the seller's own wallet, no KYC for crypto settlement; min payout ~$15 on Tron per lead — verify current terms | One manual signup; enter the Tron receive address; create the product listing | The storefront delivers the licence/download after payment; owner does nothing per sale and it settles to the wallet the dashboard already reads |
| itch.io | Storefront for tools and asset packs, pay-what-you-want supported | Free to publish; default ~10% rev share; payout requires a tax interview with a TIN and a one-time $3.00 identity fee — so it is fiat-only payout and not identity-free; verify current terms | None (fiat payout, KYC-like tax interview required) — included for reach only, not settlement | One upload; complete tax interview only if fiat payout is wanted | Free listing and open rev-share; discovery traffic comes from itch's own search |
| dev.to article footer (already live) | Content marketing on infrastructure already running daily | Free; already in production | Direct: TRC-20 address appended to every article, already validated | Write one 'problem-workaround' article whose fix is the product; address is appended automatically | Reuses the existing pipeline; the back catalogue keeps working after publish |

## Product Ideas

1. **One-annoyance browser extension with pro tier**
   - Who buys: Users of a specific site or workflow who hit the same friction daily (e.g. tab clutter, downloads naming, a specific site's missing feature)
   - Deliverable: Extension on Chrome Web Store; pro features unlock via licence from a storefront listing or after paying the address in the about page
   - Pricing model: Free tier + one-time paid upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — client-side only
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store listing, GitHub repo, dev.to article; $5 one-time store fee
2. **CLI utility or self-hostable script**
   - Who buys: Developers with a recurring one-command annoyance
   - Deliverable: Binary/archive on GitHub Releases; README and --help carry the TRC-20 address and upgrade link
   - Pricing model: Open ask / pay-what-you-want with a paid pro build
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — runs on the buyer's machine
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases, GitHub Actions, FUNDING.yml
3. **Asset pack or template set for an existing tool**
   - Who buys: Power users of that tool who want a head start
   - Deliverable: Downloaded file bundle, listed on itch.io and Getly
   - Pricing model: One-time licence per pack
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — built once, copied on delivery
   - Free stack: itch.io free listing, Getly listing, GitHub Releases mirror

## Next Actions

- Pick one product shape, build it once, and ship it free on GitHub Releases with the TRC-20 address in the README, FUNDING.yml, and the tool's own help/about output.
- Pay the one-time $5 and list the extension on Chrome Web Store for organic discovery, with the wallet ask embedded in the shipped code.
- Open a Getly account, enter the existing Tron receive address, and list the paid upgrade / download; verify current payout minimums and fees at signup.
- Mirror the same listing on itch.io if the tax interview is acceptable, and enable pay-what-you-want as a second conversion path.
- Write one problem-workaround article on dev.to whose fix is the product — the pipeline already appends the receive address.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
