# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-10-27T02:22:42.282658+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The best zero-budget route is to build the product once, ship the core free on the channels that cost nothing to list (GitHub Releases, a static page on GitHub Pages, dev.to articles the project already publishes), and take payment through two paths at once: a storefront that settles stablecoin to the owner's own wallet with no KYC (Getly is the one lead that matches this exactly, including TRC-20 USDT to the address already in use), and the direct wallet ask — the same validated Tron address printed in the README, the --help output, the docs footer, and the product page — which needs no platform, no account, and no per-sale action. Everything else either charges a listing fee, holds money in custody, or demands identity verification before payout, so it is listed as a secondary channel rather than the main one.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts; buyers pay by card or crypto, seller is paid in USDT/USDC | No monthly fee; per-transaction fee and payout minimums — verify current terms before listing | USDT/USDC including TRC-20 on Tron, directly to the seller's own wallet address, no KYC for crypto settlement — verify current terms | Create an account, upload the product file, set a price, and paste the same TRC-20 receive address the project already uses; one-time | Delivery and settlement are handled by the storefront after the one-time listing, so a sale arrives in the wallet with no owner action |
| Wallet ask on the product page, README, --help output, and docs footer | No platform at all: the validated Tron receive address printed wherever the product is seen or run | Zero — no account, no fee, no revenue cut | TRC-20 USDT to the owner's own wallet, already validated and already live on every dev.to article | Paste the existing address into the README, the product page, the --help or about output, and each release body; one-time | The address is a static string in a file; money sent to it lands on-chain with no owner involvement and no intermediary that could freeze or seize it |
| GitHub Releases with FUNDING.yml | Hosts the downloadable product free, with a Sponsor button rendered from .github/FUNDING.yml using a custom URL | Zero — same free account that already hosts the code | No built-in payments; the release notes and FUNDING.yml carry the wallet ask, so payment is direct TRC-20 USDT to the owner's wallet | Create a release with the product archive, add the address to the release body, README, and FUNDING.yml; one-time per release | Files are served by GitHub; the ask travels inside the artifact, so downloads and payments both happen with no owner action |
| Chrome Web Store | Distribution with real organic discovery for a browser extension | One-time $5 developer registration per account, no renewal, no per-extension fee, covers up to 20 extensions; the store takes no cut of a free extension — this is the only non-zero cost on this list and it must be weighed against the zero-budget constraint | None — the store lists the free extension only; monetisation is the wallet ask inside the extension and the paid upgrade sold elsewhere | Pay the one-time fee, upload the extension, publish; one-time per version | The free extension is discovered and installed without owner action; the receive path is embedded in the extension itself |
| itch.io | Free-to-upload storefront that lists tools and assets, not only games, with pay-what-you-want pricing | Free to publish, no approval queue; open revenue sharing lets the seller choose the platform cut (default around 10%) — verify current terms | Fiat only; payout requires a completed tax interview with a TIN and a one-time Tax Identity fee — verify current terms | Create account, upload, set price; payout setup requires tax information | Listing and delivery are automated; the friction is identity, not labour, so it is a secondary surface for the free tier rather than the settlement path |
| dev.to articles (already running) | Daily published articles that already carry the validated TRC-20 address in their footer | Zero — infrastructure already in use | TRC-20 USDT to the owner's own wallet, already appended by the existing publishing pipeline | Write the article about the problem the product solves, with the product as the fix; the footer ask is already automated | Articles in the back catalogue keep being read and keep showing the address, so the receive path works while nobody is working |

## Product Ideas

1. **Single-annoyance browser extension (free) with a paid upgrade**
   - Who buys: A user hitting one specific, repeated annoyance in the browser who finds the free version through store search
   - Deliverable: Free extension listed on the Chrome Web Store; the paid upgrade is a licence or unlock sold on Getly, with the wallet address in the extension's about page
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus one-time paid upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Near zero — the extension runs client-side and the store serves it
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store for distribution (one-time $5), GitHub repo for source, Getly or wallet ask for payment
2. **Single-purpose CLI utility sold as a one-time licence**
   - Who buys: A developer or power user who wants one repetitive task done from the terminal
   - Deliverable: Compiled binary or script archive on GitHub Releases; licence sold on Getly; unlicensed copies still work with the wallet ask in --help
   - Pricing model: One-time licence, with an honest-pay free version alongside
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — the buyer runs it on their own machine
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for hosting, GitHub repo for source, wallet ask in --help output and README
3. **Static client-side web tool with a paid pro tier**
   - Who buys: A non-technical user who wants a quick conversion, calculation, or cleanup without installing anything
   - Deliverable: Single-page tool on GitHub Pages; advanced features unlocked by a licence key bought on Getly, with the wallet address in the page footer
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — everything runs in the browser, no server
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages for hosting, GitHub repo for source, Getly for the paid tier
4. **Template, preset, or asset pack for a tool people already use**
   - Who buys: A user of an existing ecosystem (editor, design tool, spreadsheet, CLI) who wants a starting point
   - Deliverable: A downloadable pack sold on Getly and mirrored as a pay-what-you-want listing on itch.io, with a free sample on GitHub
   - Pricing model: One-time purchase, with a free sample tier
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — the pack is built once and downloaded many times
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases or Pages for the sample, Getly and itch.io for the paid pack
5. **Compiled data set or reference sold as a download**
   - Who buys: A developer or researcher who needs a specific reference assembled once
   - Deliverable: A static JSON, CSV, or markdown bundle on GitHub Releases, sold through Getly, with the wallet ask in the README
   - Pricing model: One-time purchase or pay-what-you-want
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — a static file
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for hosting, Getly for sale, wallet ask as the enforcement-free fallback

## Next Actions

- Pick one product shape that runs client-side or on the buyer's machine, build it once, and put the existing TRC-20 address in the README, the --help or about output, and the docs footer before publishing anything
- List the paid version on Getly with the same TRC-20 receive address, and state the fee and payout terms aloud in your own notes after verifying them on the platform's current terms page
- Upload the free version to GitHub Releases with the wallet ask in the release body, and add .github/FUNDING.yml with a custom URL so the Sponsor button points at the product page
- Write the dev.to article about the problem the product solves, using the problem-workaround framing that already outperforms build tutorials on this account, and let the existing footer pipeline append the address
- Only if the $5 one-time cost is acceptable: publish a browser extension on the Chrome Web Store as the discovery channel for the free tier, with the paid upgrade sold through Getly

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
