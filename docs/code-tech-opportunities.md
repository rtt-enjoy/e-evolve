# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-10-10T22:41:19.854823+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The lowest-friction path to passive crypto income on zero budget is to ship a free, client-side digital product (browser extension, static web tool, or CLI utility) that solves one sharp annoyance, embed the existing validated Tron (TRC-20) USDT receive address in the product's README, --help output, GitHub FUNDING.yml, and every dev.to article footer, and simultaneously list the same artifact on Getly.store for card/crypto checkout that settles USDT directly to that wallet with no KYC and no monthly fee. Discovery comes from Chrome Web Store (one-time $5 for up to 20 extensions), GitHub Releases (free hosting), dev.to articles (already running), and the product's own artifact surfaces -- no per-sale owner action required.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly.store | Digital-goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts to seller's own wallet | No listing fee, no monthly fee; platform cut verify current terms; minimum payout $15 on Tron (verify current terms) | USDT/USDC on Tron (TRC-20) and BNB Smart Chain directly to seller's wallet address; no custodian, no KYC for crypto settlement | Create account, connect Tron wallet address, create product listing, upload deliverable (license key file, Pro build zip, or asset pack), set price | Storefront handles checkout, delivery, and payout automatically; owner never touches a sale after listing |
| Chrome Web Store | Distribution and organic discovery for browser extensions | One-time $5 developer registration per account (covers up to 20 extensions); no annual renewal, no per-extension fee, no revenue share on free extensions | None (store does not process payments for free extensions); monetisation via wallet ask or external storefront | Pay $5 once, zip extension, upload via Developer Dashboard, publish | Free extension installs drive users to the Pro upgrade link or wallet address embedded in the extension; no owner action per install |
| Wallet ask on product page and in every article (already live) | Direct receive address displayed on dev.to articles, product page, and README | Zero | USDT on Tron (TRC-20) to the validated address already appended by bot/earning/payout.py | Already done — address is appended to every published article; copy same address to product page, README, FUNDING.yml, --help output | No platform, no account, no per-sale action; user sends payment directly to on-chain address |
| GitHub FUNDING.yml, README, and Releases | Displays sponsor button and wallet address on repo; hosts deliverables free | Zero | USDT on Tron (TRC-20) to address in FUNDING.yml custom field and README | Add .github/FUNDING.yml with custom: ['trx:<address>'], add address to README and each Release body | GitHub hosts files and renders address automatically; no platform holds funds; works for every clone and fork |
| GitHub Releases (artifact hosting) | Free binary/archive hosting with no storefront, no approval, no identity check | Zero | None directly; pair with wallet ask in Release notes | Tag version, attach build artifacts, write release notes containing wallet address and upgrade instructions | Deliverable downloads automatically; address in notes captures payments without owner involvement |
| Ask in the artifact (README, --help, docs footer) | Embeds receive address in every copy of the tool | Zero | USDT on Tron (TRC-20) to embedded address | Add address to README.md, CLI --help text, docs site footer, extension options page | Travels with every distribution channel (npm, GitHub, Chrome Store, direct download); reaches users who never visit the product page |
| itch.io | Storefront for tools/assets with pay-what-you-want pricing | Free to publish; platform cut default ~10% (seller adjustable); one-time $3 Tax Identity fee + completed tax interview with TIN required for any payout (verify current terms) | Fiat only (no crypto payout); KYC mandatory | Create account, complete tax interview, upload product, set pay-what-you-want or fixed price | Automated delivery and payout after initial KYC; but KYC and fiat-only disqualify it for this owner's constraints |
| dev.to articles (already running) | Content marketing on existing daily publishing infrastructure | Zero | USDT on Tron via address appended to every article | Write problem-solution article where product is the fix; bot appends address automatically | Articles publish daily without owner action; each article carries the wallet ask permanently |

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
