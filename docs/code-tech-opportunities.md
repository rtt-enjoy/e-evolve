# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-09-15T07:49:08.630981+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

Build a single zero‑cost digital product (e.g., a browser extension or CLI utility) that solves one sharp annoyance, give it away for free to earn organic discovery, and monetize through a paid upgrade or one‑time licence sold on free storefronts that settle USDT/USDC directly to the owner’s existing Tron (TRC‑20) wallet. List the same artifact on Getly (crypto payout, no KYC, no monthly fee), itch.io (pay‑what‑you‑want, free publishing), and the Chrome Web Store (one‑time $5 registration for up to 20 extensions). Keep the validated wallet address in every README, product page, and dev.to article so buyers can pay without any platform. All channels require only a one‑time manual setup; after that each sale is fully automated and incurs no per‑sale owner effort.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly | Digital‑goods storefront with native stablecoin payouts | Free to list; revenue cut – verify current terms | USDT/USDC on Tron (TRC‑20) and BNB Smart Chain directly to seller’s wallet, no KYC | Create account, add product, set payout address to existing TRC‑20 USDT address, configure price or pay‑what‑you‑want | After publishing, buyers purchase and funds settle on‑chain automatically; no owner action per sale |
| itch.io | Marketplace for tools, assets, and games with pay‑what‑you‑want pricing | Free to publish; platform cut default ~10% but seller can set 0‑100% – verify current terms | Fiat only (Stripe/PayPal); crypto leg handled by wallet address elsewhere | Sign up, upload product files, set price model (pay‑what‑you‑want or fixed), add wallet address in description | Sales processed by itch.io; payouts to bank/PayPal on schedule, no per‑sale owner work |
| Chrome Web Store | Official distribution for Chrome/Edge extensions with organic search traffic | One‑time $5 developer registration (covers up to 20 extensions), no recurring fee | None (store does not handle payments); monetisation via wallet address or external storefront | Pay $5, zip extension, submit for review, publish; add wallet address in extension description and options page | Once approved, extension is discoverable and installs automatically; no owner involvement per install |
| Direct wallet address (README / product page / dev.to footer) | Peer‑to‑peer crypto payment with zero platform | Zero | USDT/USDC on Tron (TRC‑20) directly to owner’s wallet | Copy the existing validated address into README, product landing page, and article footer | Buyer sends funds; transaction confirms on‑chain; owner never touches the sale |
| GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions (static site / CLI download) | Free hosting for product landing page and binary downloads | Free on GitHub free tier | None (hosts files only); payment via wallet address or Getly/itch.io links | Create repo, enable Pages, add download artifacts via Actions, link from other channels | Files served automatically; no server cost, no per‑download action |

## Product Ideas

1. **Tab‑Mute Toggle Extension**
   - Who buys: Power users who keep dozens of tabs open and need a one‑click mute/unmute for a specific domain
   - Deliverable: Chrome/Edge extension (CRX) with free core (mute current tab) and paid upgrade (domain‑level rules, keyboard shortcut, sync across devices)
   - Pricing model: Free tier + one‑time licence for Pro features (sold on Getly and itch.io)
   - Cost per extra user: Zero – extension runs entirely client‑side

   - Pricing model: Free pack on VS Code Marketplace (free), paid pack via Getly/itch.io
   - Cost per extra user: Zero – JSON file
   - Free stack: VS Code Marketplace (free), Getly, itch.io, wallet address
5. **Self‑Hosted Markdown‑to‑PDF Script**
   - Who buys: Technical writers who need reproducible PDF builds without cloud services
   - Deliverable: Node/Python script + Dockerfile – free version renders basic PDF; paid version adds custom CSS, cover page, and batch processing
   - Pricing model: One‑time licence on Getly (crypto) and itch.io (fiat)
   - Cost per extra user: Zero – script runs on buyer’s machine
   - Free stack: GitHub repo with Actions for release builds, GitHub Pages for docs, Getly/itch.io for sales

## Next Actions

- Pick one product idea, build the minimal free version (client‑side only) and a paid upgrade artefact.
- Create a Getly storefront, configure USDT/USDC TRC‑20 payout to the existing wallet address, and list the paid upgrade.
- Publish the same product on itch.io with pay‑what‑you‑want or fixed price, adding the wallet address in the description.
- Register a Chrome Web Store developer account ($5 one‑time), submit the free extension (or zip for other shapes), and include the wallet address in the store listing.
- Add the validated TRC‑20 USDT address to the project README, GitHub Pages landing page, and the dev.to article footer; write a problem‑focused dev.to article that positions the product as the solution.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
