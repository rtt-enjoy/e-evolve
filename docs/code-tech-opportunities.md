# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-12T07:01:45.937715+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

On zero budget, the realistic passive route is a client-side digital product (browser extension, static tool, asset pack, or template) that costs nothing per user, shipped free on GitHub Releases and other zero-cost storefronts, with payment taken via a stablecoin receive address (the already-validated TRC-20 USDT address) printed on the product page, in the README, in FUNDING.yml, and inside the tool's own output. For a licence-delivered sale with enforcement, Getly is the only lead here with native stablecoin settlement to the seller's own wallet and no KYC; verify its current terms before relying on it. Chrome Web Store ($5 one-time) is the one paid step worth making for extension discovery. No revenue is estimated: real earnings are the on-chain balance only.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Releases + FUNDING.yml + README (already-running account) | Free hosting of binaries/archives and an in-repo receive path via the Sponsor button's custom URL field | Zero; no listing fee, no revenue cut | Whatever the owner's receive address accepts — USDT on Tron (TRC-20), direct to own wallet, no custodian, no KYC | One-time: add .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, paste address into README and each release body, tag a release | The artifact and the ask are both static; downloads and payments occur with zero owner action |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront; buyers pay by card or crypto, seller paid out in stablecoins | No monthly fee per lead; min payout $15 on Tron (~$5 on BNB Chain) and ~$0.50–1 Tron network fee per lead — verify current terms before relying | USDT/USDC to the seller's own wallet address, TRC-20 supported; no KYC for crypto settlement — verify current terms | One-time: create account, list the product, paste the validated Tron receive address as payout destination | The storefront delivers the paid licence/download automatically; sales settle to the wallet the dashboard already reads |
| Wallet ask on product page and in the artifact (already live) | Payment with no platform: the validated TRC-20 address on the product page, in --help output, docs footer, and about screen | Zero | USDT (TRC-20) direct to own wallet; verifiable on-chain | One-time: paste the address into the README, product page, and the tool's own output before publishing | Every copy and fork carries the ask; reaches users who never open a storefront, no per-sale action |
| Chrome Web Store | Distribution for browser extensions with real organic discovery | One-time $5 developer registration; covers up to 20 extensions; store takes no cut of free extensions (only non-zero cost here) | N/A — store pays nothing; monetize via the wallet ask in the extension and a paid upgrade sold on Getly or GitHub Releases | One-time: pay $5, register, upload the extension with the address in its about/settings screen | Listing persists and surfaces to organic search; updates are occasional, not per-sale |
| itch.io | Storefront for tools and asset packs, pay-what-you-want supported | Free to publish; seller chooses platform's revenue share (default ~10%) | None — fiat only; payout requires tax interview (TIN) and a one-time $3 identity fee, so it is KYC-gated | One-time: complete tax interview, upload listing, set price model | Listings persist and deliver downloads automatically; include only if the owner accepts the KYC trade-off — otherwise skip |

## Product Ideas

1. **Single-annoyance browser extension (freemium)**
   - Who buys: Users hit daily by one specific annoyance the free tier only partially solves (e.g. tab cleanup, timestamp conversion)
   - Deliverable: Free extension on Chrome Web Store; Pro tier unlock licence bought on Getly or paid via the in-extension wallet address
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid one-time Pro upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — runs entirely client-side, no backend
   - Free stack: Client-side JS only; Chrome Web Store listing; GitHub repo for issues
2. **Self-hostable CLI utility sold as a downloadable release**
   - Who buys: Developers with a narrow, recurring chore (format conversion, log parsing, config linting)
   - Deliverable: Binary/archive on GitHub Releases; payment ask in README, --help output, and release notes; optional paid build via Getly
   - Pricing model: Free core plus pay-what-you-want wallet ask; one-time licence variant via Getly
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — buyer runs it on their own machine
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases hosting; GitHub Actions for build; Pages for the landing page
3. **Template/preset/asset pack for a tool people already use**
   - Who buys: Users of a popular tool who want a curated config, theme, or starter kit
   - Deliverable: Zip download; free mirror on GitHub Releases with wallet ask, optional itch.io listing if KYC is acceptable
   - Pricing model: Pay-what-you-want / one-time licence
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — compiled once, downloaded many times
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for delivery; README and product page carry the TRC-20 address
4. **Static client-side web tool with Pro URL or paid bundle**
   - Who buys: Anyone with the one problem the tool solves, arriving via search or the dev.to article
   - Deliverable: Free hosted tool on GitHub Pages; paid downloadable/offline Pro version sold on Getly or via wallet ask
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid one-time upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — GitHub Pages free tier, no server
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages, client-side JS, existing dev.to publishing for the article that sells it

## Next Actions

- Paste the validated TRC-20 USDT receive address into the product page, README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, and the tool's own --help/about output; publish the artifact on GitHub Releases.
- Create a Getly account, confirm current payout terms (min $15 Tron, fees — verify current terms), set the existing Tron address as payout, and list the paid tier as a digital download.
- Ship the free tier of the extension on Chrome Web Store (one-time $5, the only non-zero cost) with the address in its settings/about screen.
- Write one dev.to problem-workaround article where the product is the fix and the article footer (which already carries the address) is the ask — reuses the already-running publishing pipeline.
- Mirror the same artifact on every remaining zero-cost channel (additional releases, README badges) and check the on-chain balance weekly as the only revenue metric.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
