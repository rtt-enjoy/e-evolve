# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-10T04:34:06.929148+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The best current route is to build the product once, distribute it free through channels with zero listing cost (GitHub Releases for the artifact, Chrome Web Store for an extension, itch.io for asset packs), and take money either through a no-KYC storefront that settles USDT on Tron directly to the owner's own wallet (Getly is the one live candidate in the lead set; verify current terms before relying on it) or through the already-validated Tron receive address printed on the product page, README, FUNDING.yml, and inside the tool's own output. The free tier buys the discovery the owner cannot pay for; the paid upgrade or the honest wallet ask is the price; no per-sale owner action exists anywhere in the chain.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getly storefront | Digital-goods storefront with card and crypto checkout, seller paid out in stablecoins | No monthly fee; platform revenue cut: verify current terms | USDT/USDC to the seller's own wallet; TRC-20 supported (minimum payout ~$15 on Tron — verify current terms and limits) | One-time account creation, product listing, and entering the existing Tron receive address as payout destination | Storefront handles checkout, license delivery, and payout per sale; owner touches nothing after listing |
| Wallet ask on product page and README (already live) | Direct USDT/TRC-20 payment to the validated receive address, no intermediary | Zero | USDT on Tron, directly to the owner's own wallet, no custodian, no KYC | Paste the existing address into the product page, README, and FUNDING.yml custom field — one manual edit | Payment is user-initiated and lands on-chain; nothing to fulfil, no per-sale action |
| GitHub Releases + FUNDING.yml | Free hosting of binaries/archives and a rendered sponsor button from the existing repo account | Zero on the free tier; no listing fee, no cut | None from GitHub itself; the FUNDING.yml custom: field carries the Tron address so payment bypasses GitHub entirely | Add .github/FUNDING.yml, attach the artifact to a Release, put the address in README and release notes — one-time | Downloads serve themselves; nothing can freeze, seize, or gate the receive path |
| Chrome Web Store | The distribution channel with real organic discovery for browser extensions | One-time $5 developer registration per account, covers up to 20 extensions; store takes no cut of free extensions; only non-zero cost in this plan — verify current terms | None; the store is distribution only, monetisation is the in-product wallet ask or a paid upgrade sold via Getly | Pay the one-time $5 fee, upload and submit the extension once | The store handles updates, reviews, and discovery; a paying user is directed to the wallet or storefront link with no owner involvement |
| itch.io | Free-to-upload storefront for tools and asset packs, supports pay-what-you-want | Free to publish; open revenue share (default ~10%, seller-adjustable); a $3.00 one-time Tax Identity fee and a completed tax interview with a TIN are required before payout — verify current terms | None — fiat only; disqualified for the payout requirement unless the owner accepts KYC-adjacent fiat settlement | Upload, price, complete tax interview and pay the $3 identity fee before any payout | Downloads and payments are fully automated after listing |

## Product Ideas

1. **One-annoyance browser extension with paid tier**
   - Who buys: A user hit daily by one specific site behaviour (e.g. a cluttered interface, forced redirects, missing keyboard shortcut)
   - Deliverable: Free extension on Chrome Web Store; paid tier unlocks extra options, sold via Getly with USDT/Tron settlement; wallet ask in the extension's about/options page
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid upgrade (licence key verified client-side)
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — the extension runs in the buyer's browser
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store listing, GitHub repo for issues and README, existing Tron receive address
2. **Single-purpose CLI utility, free binary with paid pack**
   - Who buys: Developers who hit the same repetitive task (a format conversion, a log cleaner, a scaffolder)
   - Deliverable: Free binary on GitHub Releases with the address in README and --help output; a paid preset/config pack delivered by Getly on purchase
   - Pricing model: Free tool plus one-time licence for the companion pack; wallet ask for those who skip the storefront
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — buyer runs it on their own machine
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for hosting, GitHub Pages for the landing page, existing Tron address
3. **Template/preset/asset pack for a popular tool**
   - Who buys: Users of an established tool (editor themes, automation templates, config presets) who want a working starting point
   - Deliverable: A downloadable archive, hosted free on GitHub Releases and listed on a Getly storefront row for automated delivery; itch.io only if the owner accepts the tax interview
   - Pricing model: One-time licence per pack, delivered by the storefront with no owner action
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — built once, downloaded many times
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases hosting, existing Tron address on the landing page and in the pack's own README

## Next Actions

- Reuse the validated Tron receive address everywhere: product landing page, GitHub README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, release notes, and the tool's own --help/about output — a one-time manual edit that makes every distributed copy a payment path
- Pick one product shape, build it client-side or self-hostable so each additional user costs nothing, and ship the base version free on GitHub Releases (and Chrome Web Store, paying the one-time $5, only if it is an extension)
- Open a Getly account once, list the paid upgrade or pack, and set USDT/TRC-20 payout to the existing wallet address — verifying current fees, minimum payout, and terms before launch
- Write one dev.to article on the problem the product solves (problem-workaround shape, which outperforms ~25x on this account) with the address in the footer, reusing infrastructure already running
- Mirror the product across every remaining zero-cost channel (GitHub Pages landing page, any other free listing found during verification) since the artifact is already built and each listing is a one-time signup

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
