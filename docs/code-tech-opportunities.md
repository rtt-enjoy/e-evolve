# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-10T14:53:36.559880+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The highest-confidence zero-budget route is a client-side digital product (a single-purpose browser extension, CLI utility, or downloadable asset pack) hosted entirely on GitHub Releases and Pages, sold via an unenforced or storefront-delivered licence, with the already-validated TRC-20 USDT receive address printed in the README, FUNDING.yml, --help output, product page, and dev.to article footers. The only channel with real organic discovery for extensions is the Chrome Web Store, which costs a one-time $5 per account covering up to 20 extensions. Getly is the one storefront candidate that claims free listing with direct-to-wallet USDT on Tron and no KYC for crypto settlement, but its terms should be verified before relying on it. Every element runs on infrastructure the project already pays for; nothing charges per sale and no platform holds the money.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wallet ask (already live) — README, FUNDING.yml, --help, product page, dev.to footers | Lets any user pay USDT on Tron straight to the owner's wallet with no platform | Zero. No account, no fee, no cut | USDT (TRC-20) directly to the owner's own validated receive address; settlement on-chain | Paste the existing address into README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom: field, --help/about output, docs footer, and product page — one-time edits to files already maintained | Payment happens whenever a user decides to; nothing to fulfil, nothing to approve, verifiable on-chain |
| GitHub Releases + GitHub Pages | Free hosting and distribution for binaries, archives, and a static product page | Zero on the free tier; GitHub takes nothing | None directly — pair it with the wallet ask; buyers pay the Tron address | One-time: tag a release with the built artifact, publish a static page on Pages, add the address to release notes | Downloads and reads are served by GitHub indefinitely; nothing per sale |
| Chrome Web Store | Distribution with real organic discovery for browser extensions | One-time $5 developer registration per account, covers up to 20 extensions; no renewal, no per-extension fee, no cut of free extensions — the only non-zero cost on this table | None; the store only distributes. Monetise via the paid-tier licence sold through Getly or the wallet ask | One-time: pay $5, register the account, upload and publish the extension | Store search brings users with no ongoing marketing; updates are the only recurring manual work |
| Getly | Digital-goods storefront with card (Stripe) and crypto checkout, stablecoin payouts | Claimed free to list, no monthly fee; minimum payout $15 on Tron — verify current terms before relying on any figure | USDT/USDC to the seller's own wallet address, claimed no KYC for crypto settlement; Tron (TRC-20) supported, matching the existing receive address — verify current terms | One-time: create an account, set the payout wallet to the existing Tron address, create the product listing and delivery file | Storefront handles payment and automated digital delivery; no owner action per sale |
| itch.io | Storefront for tools and asset packs with pay-what-you-want pricing | Free to upload; seller-chosen revenue share (default ~10%); payout requires a completed tax interview with a TIN and a one-time $3.00 identity fee — verify current terms | None; fiat only, custodial until payout | One-time: upload the product, set pricing, complete the tax interview and identity fee before payout is possible | Listings run indefinitely with no per-sale work; included despite the KYC trade-off because listing is free and it is a real discovery surface |

## Product Ideas

1. **Tab-clutter one-click cleanup extension**
   - Who buys: Researchers and heavy tab users drowning in dozens of open tabs
   - Deliverable: Free extension: close/duplicate-tab cleanup. Paid upgrade: saved session snapshots, rules, and auto-cleanup — unlocked by a licence key delivered by the storefront
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus paid one-time licence upgrade
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — all logic runs client-side, no server
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store listing ($5 one-time), GitHub repo, Getly or wallet address for the paid licence
2. **File-renamer / bulk-converter CLI utility**
   - Who buys: Photographers, devs, and data wranglers with recurring batch-file chores
   - Deliverable: Single static binary or script downloaded from GitHub Releases; paid tier unlocks batch presets and scripting hooks via a licence file
   - Pricing model: Free core plus paid one-time licence, with an unenforced wallet ask in --help and the README
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — buyer runs it on their own machine
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for binaries, GitHub Pages for the landing page, FUNDING.yml for the address
3. **Preset/asset pack for a tool people already use**
   - Who buys: Users of a popular editor or framework who want working configurations, not a blank canvas
   - Deliverable: Downloadable archive of presets, templates, or assets, delivered by the storefront automatically
   - Pricing model: One-time licence or pay-what-you-want; wallet ask printed in the included README
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — built once, downloaded many times
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases hosting, itch.io and/or Getly listings, dev.to article about the problem the pack solves with the address in the footer

## Next Actions

- Paste the validated TRC-20 USDT receive address into the product README, .github/FUNDING.yml custom field, --help/about output, docs footer, and product landing page — the channel already running, extended to the artifact
- Pick one product shape (a client-side browser extension is the strongest fit), build the free tier, and publish it on GitHub Releases and GitHub Pages on the free tier
- Pay the one-time $5 Chrome Web Store registration and publish the extension free, so store search does the discovery
- Verify Getly's current terms (fees, $15 Tron minimum payout, no-KYC crypto settlement), then create one listing with the payout wallet set to the existing Tron address and automated delivery of the paid-tier licence
- Write one dev.to problem-workaround article about the annoyance the product fixes, with the product link and the existing address in the footer — marketing on infrastructure already running

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
