# Passive Product Income Queue

Refreshed: 2026-11-08T23:49:26.023100+00:00

Routes to passive income from a digital product on a zero budget: where it can
be listed and paid for (channels) and what can build or market it (assets).

**Freelance and contract postings are deliberately absent.** Income per hour of
the owner's time is a job, not passive income, so those sources were removed
rather than demoted.

No revenue figure appears on this page. Real revenue is the on-chain wallet
balance, and a listing is not a receipt.

## Requirements

- Every lead must move a digital product toward earning without the owner in the loop.
- Rank by how little owner action each unit of income needs, not by headline upside.
- Name where the money lands, and prefer stablecoin to the address this project already publishes.
- State every cost and every manual setup step out loud; zero budget is the constraint.
- Never suggest selling the owner's hours: a rate per hour is a job, not passive income.
- Stay inside policy: no social posting, no trading, no minting, no cold outreach.
- Do not count discovery, pipeline, or speculative upside as earnings. On-chain or nothing.

## Current Best Angle

The best zero-budget route is to build the product once, host it free on GitHub (Releases, Pages, npm), and let three receive paths run in parallel: the TRC-20 USDT address already appended to every dev.to article, the same address embedded in the README, --help output and release notes, and a free-to-list digital-goods storefront that settles stablecoin directly to that wallet with no KYC and no custodian. The free tier of the product does the discovery the owner cannot afford to buy, the paid upgrade or licence is the price, and every channel listed below needs only one-time manual setup, never per-sale work. Nothing here holds the owner's money before the owner does, no platform charges a monthly fee, and the only non-zero cost anywhere is the Chrome Web Store's one-time $5, which is stated rather than hidden.

## Sales Channels

| Channel | What it lists | Cost | Crypto payout | Owner setup | Why passive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct wallet ask (TRC-20 USDT) in the product itself | No platform at all: the validated receive address printed in the README, --help output, docs footer, and release notes. | Zero. No listing fee, no cut, no account. | USDT on Tron (TRC-20), direct to the wallet the project already uses; fully non-custodial, no KYC. | Paste the existing address into the README, --help text, docs footer, and each release body — one time per release. | Payment is a plain on-chain transfer; there is no platform to fulfil, no payout threshold and no owner action per sale. |
| GitHub Releases + FUNDING.yml custom URL | Hosts the downloadable product free and renders a Sponsor button from .github/FUNDING.yml with a custom URL (no GitHub Sponsors enrolment, no Stripe Connect, no W-9). | Free; no storefront, no listing fee, no approval queue, no identity check. | Whatever the custom URL points to — here the same TRC-20 address, so settlement is direct to the owner's wallet. | Create the release, write the release notes with the ask, add .github/FUNDING.yml with a custom: field. | Downloads are served by GitHub; the ask travels with every copy and fork. Nothing can be seized or geo-blocked, but enforcement is zero — it converts worse than a paywall by design. |
| Getly (digital-goods storefront, stablecoin payout) | Lists a digital download or licence key and delivers it automatically after payment; buyers pay by card or crypto, seller is paid out in USDT/USDC. | No monthly fee; per-transaction fee and minimum payout — verify current terms before relying on any number. | USDT/USDC including Tron (TRC-20), stated to go directly to the seller's own wallet with no KYC for crypto settlement; minimum payout on Tron reported as $15 — verify current terms. | One signup, one product listing, paste the TRC-20 receive address as the payout address. | The storefront handles delivery and settlement; a sale lands in the wallet the dashboard already reads with no owner action. |
| itch.io (free-to-publish storefront, fiat only) | Lists tools and asset packs, not only games; supports pay-what-you-want and open revenue sharing (seller chooses the platform's cut, default ~10%). | Free to upload, no approval queue, no upfront fee; payout requires a completed tax interview with a TIN and a one-time $3.00 Tax Identity fee. | None — fiat payout only, and identity-gated. Listed as the cautionary example, not the recommendation. | Upload the product, set pay-what-you-want pricing, complete the tax interview. | Delivery is automated, but being paid is not identity-free, so it fails the no-KYC preference. |
| Chrome Web Store (only for a browser extension) | The one distribution channel with real organic discovery for extensions; the store takes no cut of a free extension. | One-time $5 developer registration per account, no annual renewal, covers up to 20 extensions — the only non-zero cost on this list, stated because zero budget is the binding constraint. | None from the store itself; monetisation is the wallet ask or a paid upgrade sold through a storefront row. | Pay the one-time $5, upload the extension, put the receive address in the listing description and the extension's own about page. | The free extension is distributed and updated by the store; the ask inside the extension travels with every install. |

## Product Ideas

1. **Single-purpose browser extension that fixes one annoyance**
   - Who buys: Power users of a specific site or workflow who hit that one annoyance daily and find it in the Chrome Web Store search.
   - Deliverable: Free extension in the store; paid upgrade unlocks a second feature or a preset pack, delivered as a licence key from the storefront.
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus one-time licence for the upgrade; wallet ask in the extension's about page.
   - Cost per extra user: Near zero — the store serves the download; the one-time $5 registration is the only fixed cost.
   - Free stack: Chrome Web Store (after $5), GitHub repo for source, TRC-20 address in the listing and the extension itself.
2. **CLI utility that automates one tedious task**
   - Who buys: Developers and sysadmins who find it via search, the dev.to article, or the repo itself.
   - Deliverable: Binary or archive on GitHub Releases; pro tier as a second binary or a config pack sold through the storefront.
   - Pricing model: Free tier with an honest ask in the release notes, plus a one-time licence for the pro build.
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — GitHub Releases serves every download free.
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases, README and --help ask, dev.to article footer already carrying the address.
3. **Static web tool that runs entirely client-side**
   - Who buys: Non-technical users who arrive from search or the article and want the result without installing anything.
   - Deliverable: Single-page tool on GitHub Pages; paid tier is an unlocked mode, a batch feature, or a downloadable preset pack.
   - Pricing model: Free tier plus one-time licence for the paid mode; wallet ask in the page footer.
   - Cost per extra user: Zero per user — client-side, no server, no API bill.
   - Free stack: GitHub Pages (static hosting, free tier), GitHub Actions if any scheduled build is needed, TRC-20 address in the footer.
4. **Template, preset, or asset pack for a tool people already use**
   - Who buys: Users of that tool who want the pack now and will not build it themselves.
   - Deliverable: A zip of templates or presets, delivered automatically by the storefront after payment.
   - Pricing model: One-time licence, pay-what-you-want above a floor, or free sample pack plus paid full pack.
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — the same zip is downloaded any number of times.
   - Free stack: Storefront listing (Getly), GitHub Releases as a mirror, wallet ask in the pack's own README.
5. **Data set or reference compiled once, sold as a download**
   - Who buys: Anyone who needs the compiled reference and values the hours it saves.
   - Deliverable: A single downloadable file (JSON, CSV, or markdown bundle) hosted on GitHub Releases and sold through the storefront.
   - Pricing model: One-time licence with a free sample subset; wallet ask in the data's own README.
   - Cost per extra user: Zero — compiled once, copied infinitely.
   - Free stack: GitHub Releases for hosting, storefront for the paid full set, existing dev.to articles as the discovery channel.

## Next Actions

- Pick one product shape from the list above and build the free tier so it costs nothing per user to run — client-side or downloadable, no server, no API bill.
- Put the validated TRC-20 receive address in four places at once: the README, the --help or about output, the docs or page footer, and .github/FUNDING.yml as a custom URL. This is the receive path that needs no platform and no account.

## Monetization Patterns

- Ship the tool free and sell the upgrade: the free tier buys discovery the owner cannot.
- One-time licence for a digital download, delivered by the storefront with no owner action.
- Put the published receive address on the product page and in the README, so a user can pay with no platform at all.
- Sell a template, preset, or asset pack built once and downloaded many times.
- Charge for the paid tier of a tool whose free tier costs nothing per user to run.
- List the same product on every zero-cost channel, since the artifact is already built.

## Underserved Niches

- storefronts that settle stablecoin straight to the seller's own wallet, no custodian
- one-task tools that solve a single annoyance well enough to be worth paying for
- products with zero marginal cost per user, so the free tier can stay free forever
- channels that are free to list on and have no approval queue to fail
- paying users who never open a storefront and would rather send stablecoin directly
- distribution with real organic discovery, so reach does not need ad spend
- products whose buyers are developers, since that is the audience already reached

## Strategy Playbook

- Build the product once, then spend every later cycle on distribution rather than on more product.
- Keep marginal cost per user at zero: client-side code, free hosting, free scheduler. Every dollar in is margin.
- Put the receive path on the artifact itself -- product page, README, article footer -- not only on a storefront.
- List on the free channels first; pay a listing fee only where discovery is worth it, and say what it cost.
- Let the articles this bot already publishes do the marketing: the problem is the post, the product is the fix.
- Price once and leave it. A price that needs renegotiating per buyer is a service in disguise.
- Measure only what arrives on-chain. Listings, views and pipeline are not revenue.

## Avoid

- Selling the owner's hours: freelance postings, contract work, retainers, consulting. Income per unit of work is a job.
- Anything requiring paid infrastructure, a monthly fee, or a credit-card-gated tier.
- Custodial payment processors that hold the money before the owner does, and anything demanding KYC to receive.
- Platforms that are dead, seized, or unverifiable. Sellix was seized in 2024 and is still widely recommended.
- Trading, minting, yield farming, staking and airdrops: refused in code, and not a product business.
- Offers needing a large audience, ad spend, or a following the owner does not have.
- Anything promising passive income without a product that delivers something.

## Refused Channels

Written down so a later cycle does not re-derive them, and so a dead
platform cannot climb back onto this page.

- **Sellix:** Seized and shut down in 2024. Still widely recommended as the crypto storefront, which is exactly why it is written down here as refused.
- **Gumroad (for crypto):** Does not natively accept crypto and pays out USD via Stripe only. Fine as a fiat storefront; it is not a crypto receive path, and mrr_ideas should not imply it is.
- **Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi (main platforms):** No native stablecoin field for a supporter's own wallet. Ko-fi Web3 is a separate product on BEP-20 only, so the wallet footer already covers this better.
- **Any custodial crypto payment processor:** Holds the money before the owner does. The published Tron address is non-custodial and already works; adding a custodian adds KYC risk for no gain.
- **Coinbase Commerce:** DEFUNCT. Permanently shut down 2026-03-31 for merchants outside the US/Singapore, with no extensions offered. Its replacement (Coinbase Business) is fully custodial and US/Singapore only. Still recommended in current listicles -- a Sellix-class trap.
- **CoinPayments:** Geo-dead and KYC-mandatory. EU/EEA service discontinued after 2026-07-01 under MiCA, and the current platform requires identity verification for all users, not just above a threshold.
- **kofi.network:** IMPOSTOR RISK -- not affiliated with ko-fi.com despite the name and a '(c) 2026 Ko-fi' footer. No operator disclosure. It advertises wallet-to-wallet USDT on BEP-20, which is exactly the property that would rank it highly here, which is why it is written down as refused rather than left to be rediscovered.
- **NOWPayments (as a direct channel):** Marketed as non-custodial, but the default flow routes funds through their wallet and KYC triggers at volume and always for fiat. Reached indirectly anyway: it is the rail Getly uses to dispatch payouts, so using it directly adds a custodian without adding a storefront.
- **Gitcoin / Allo:** Wound down. Grants Lab and Grants Stack reached end-of-life 2025-05-31 and Allo is in maintenance mode. KYC applies above $15k matching regardless.
- **Drips Network:** Genuinely non-custodial and plausibly identity-free, but Ethereum ERC-20 only. It cannot reach the Tron address this project publishes, so it would need a second address and a second meter (Principle 3f) to earn a cent.
- **BTCPay Server:** The only fully non-custodial, fee-free, no-KYC option on the table -- and it needs a server. This project has none (GitHub Actions is outbound-only), and third-party hosting reintroduces the dependency it exists to avoid. Refused on infrastructure, not on merit.
- **Gumroad, Substack, Polar, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Payhip, Liberapay, Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, Open Collective:** All require identity verification, directly or through Stripe/PayPal onboarding, and none settles crypto to a seller-controlled address. Verified 2026-09-15 after the owner hit exactly this wall on Gumroad and Substack. Buy Me a Coffee is the specific trap: it accepts crypto from buyers but converts to USD and pays out via Stripe, US accounts only.
