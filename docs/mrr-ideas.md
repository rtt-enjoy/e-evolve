# Recurring Revenue (MRR) Idea Triage

Refreshed: 2026-09-03T12:19:29.529971+00:00

Research and suggestions only. This bot does not contact anyone, collect
payment, or host a service. Every figure quoted from the source article
is unverified — check it yourself before acting on it.

## What This Stack Can Actually Support

- Runs on GitHub Actions free tier: hourly, outbound-only, no always-on server.
- No inbound HTTP. Nothing can accept a request, a form, or a webhook.
- No payment processing. Nothing can charge a card or bill a subscription.
- No outreach. Cold email, DMs, and social posting are refused in code.
- Can research, analyse, draft, and publish articles to dev.to. That is the whole surface.

## Surviving Models (no LLM brief this refresh)

| Model | MRR model | Bot can | Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paid newsletter | $10-20/mo per subscriber | publish | 65 |
| Notion / digital template store | $500-5K/mo, library subscription | draft | 60 |

## Set Up By Hand First

None of these is a blocker — but no money moves until you do them.

- **Paid newsletter:** owner opens a payment/subscription account by hand (Gumroad, Substack, Stripe); owner opens the storefront or channel by hand (Gumroad products can then be created/updated via its API); needs an existing audience; the dev.to byline is the only one this stack builds
- **Notion / digital template store:** owner opens a payment/subscription account by hand (Gumroad, Substack, Stripe); owner opens the storefront or channel by hand (Gumroad products can then be created/updated via its API)

## Refused, And Why

These are not oversights. Each one needs an action this project refuses in
code, or infrastructure that does not exist here and is not free.
